It allows you to remove unwanted backgrounds or objects from an image, change its color, or even create a mask. But many users need help using the Background Eraser tool for their pictures.</p><p>To simplify things, we’ll provide basic information about the eraser tools in Photoshop.</p><p>So, if you are ready to learn how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop"><a href="#Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop"></a>Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop</h2><p>The <strong>eraser tools in Photoshop</strong> can be used to create transparent backgrounds or to remove unwanted background elements from an image. These tools work by sampling the color of the pixels in the image and then erasing pixels that match the sampled color.</p><p>There are three main variations of eraser tools in Photoshop:</p><ul><li>Eraser</li><li>Background Eraser</li><li>Magic Eraser</li></ul><p>Many people need clarification with Photoshop’s Background Eraser and Magic Eraser tools. Therefore, we’ve discussed their similarities and dissimilarities. You can understand them better and so that you can prefer the one that suits your needs:</p><h3 id="Similarities"><a href="#Similarities" class="headerlink" title="Similarities"></a>Similarities</h3><p>The following are the similarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Erase Pixels Based On Colors:</strong> The Background Eraser tool and Magic Eraser tool can erase pixels based on their color. This means you can select a color, and the tool will erase all the related pixels.</p><p><strong>Destructive Tools:</strong> Both the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser are destructive tools in nature. They delete the pixels you erase. Therefore, you cannot undo or redo your changes once you’ve used either of these tools. However, there are some non-native workarounds to restore your images.</p><h3 id="Dissimilarities"><a href="#Dissimilarities" class="headerlink" title="Dissimilarities"></a>Dissimilarities</h3><p>Here are some dissimilarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: To use the Background Eraser tool, you have to hover over the area in your image to erase it based on the pixels you paint over. On the other hand, the Magic Eraser tool instantly erases similar pixels based on your selected color.</p><p><strong>Adjustment Settings</strong>: The Background Eraser offers more adjustment tools than the Magic Eraser. For instance, the former offers Sampling, Limits, Brush size, Tolerance, Angle, and Protect Foreground Color settings, while the latter includes Tolerance, Anto-alias, Contiguous, Sample All Layers, and Opacity options.</p><p>Each tool’s diversity in options significantly affects the final image’s quality. For example, the Magic Eraser Tool erases areas rapidly, though there is limited control over which pixels are deleted.</p><h2 id="Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial"><a href="#Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial"></a>Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial</h2><p>Before starting our tutorial on <strong>how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop,</strong> let’s first discuss the adjustment options enabled when selecting the tool and working with them. In this way, you can better understand the steps in the guidance.</p><h3 id="1-Brush-Preset-Picker"><a href="#1-Brush-Preset-Picker" class="headerlink" title="1. Brush Preset Picker"></a>1. Brush Preset Picker</h3><p>When you enable the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, you will see that the cursor changes to a brush, indicating that this tool works like other <strong>“Brush Tools.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/bruch-preset-picker-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="bruch preset picker function in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>The <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> is the first option that opens up a panel to let you adjust the size of your brush, its hardness, spacing, and tolerance. You can also change the size using the <strong>Left Bracket ([)</strong> and <strong>Right Bracket (])</strong>  keys on your PC keyboard.</p><p>To adjust the hardness, press the <strong>“Shift+ Left Bracket”</strong> or <strong>“Shift+Right Bracket”</strong> keys. We recommend that you set it to <strong>100%</strong> when erasing the pixels from your image.</p><h3 id="2-Sampling-Options"><a href="#2-Sampling-Options" class="headerlink" title="2. Sampling Options"></a>2. Sampling Options</h3><p>In the Background Eraser tool’s <strong>Options bar,</strong> you will find the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> that includes three different icons with different behaviors:</p><p><strong>Continuous</strong>: This option is selected by default and works best on an image with a colorful background because it removes different pixels as you drag your brush around your picture.</p><p><strong>Once</strong>: If your image’s background does not have many colors, this setting will work best. This is because it removes a single pixel at a time.</p><p><strong>Background Swatch</strong>: You may sometimes have difficulty positioning the crosshair tool precisely over the color you wish to erase. To prevent this, you can use the Background Swatch Option that helps you pick a color and will only erase the activated color from the BG.</p><h3 id="3-Limits"><a href="#3-Limits" class="headerlink" title="3. Limits"></a>3. Limits</h3><p>After you pick a color to erase, the Limits function identifies the location of the pixels that match that color, making it easier for you to erase them precisely.</p><p>The Limit function comes with three options:</p><p><strong>Contiguous:</strong> It’s a default option that erases pixels of the same color touched by the crosshair, which means that it won’t remove any isolated area of pixels located in other image elements.</p><p><strong>Discontiguous:</strong> When you enable the Discontiguous option, Photoshop can erase any pixels in the image that match the sampled color, regardless of whether or not they are touching the crosshair.</p><p><strong>Find Edges:</strong> This setting will come in handy when you find that the edges around your subject are not sharp enough. The Find Edges option works more precisely than the Contiguous and helps to smooth down the sides.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/limits-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="limits function in background eraser tool"                ></p><h3 id="4-Tolerance"><a href="#4-Tolerance" class="headerlink" title="4. Tolerance"></a>4. Tolerance</h3><p>Located directly to the right of the Limits function, Tolerance is one of the most important options in Background Eraser, as it signifies how much a pixel’s shade can vary from the sampled color for Photoshop to erase it.</p><p>By default, the Tolerance’s value is set to <strong>50%</strong>. But you should attempt a lower Tolerance setting if your background color is somewhat similar to the subject and Photoshop erases its parts while removing the background.</p><p>If, however, the background color is fringing around the subject, use a higher Tolerance value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/tolerance-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="tolerance function in background eraser tool"                ></p><h3 id="5-Brush-Angle"><a href="#5-Brush-Angle" class="headerlink" title="5. Brush Angle"></a>5. Brush Angle</h3><p>The Brush Angle option can help you adjust the angle of your crosshair to quickly erase the pixels in difficult-to-reach areas in your image’s background. You can also hit the <strong>“R”</strong> key on your keyboard to rotate the canvas.</p><h3 id="6-Protect-Foreground-Color"><a href="#6-Protect-Foreground-Color" class="headerlink" title="6. Protect Foreground Color"></a>6. Protect Foreground Color</h3><p>Sometimes, Photoshop erases parts of your subject while removing the background, no matter what Tolerance value you use. To avoid this, the Protected Foreground Color option in the Options bar can come in handy.</p><p>This option allows you to choose a color from your subject as a foreground color, and Photoshop will stop erasing it while you drag the brush over the image to remove the background.</p><h3 id="7-Pen-Pressure"><a href="#7-Pen-Pressure" class="headerlink" title="7. Pen Pressure"></a>7. Pen Pressure</h3><p>Pen Pressure is helpful if you use a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. With this option selected, the crosshair opacity will be regulated based on the pressure applied with your pen on the tablet.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Background-Eraser-Tool-To-Erase-An-Image-Background"><a href="#How-To-Use-Background-Eraser-Tool-To-Erase-An-Image-Background" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Background Eraser Tool To Erase An Image Background?"></a>How To Use Background Eraser Tool To Erase An Image Background?</h2><p>The following steps will help you learn how to erase your image background using Photoshop’s Background Eraser tool.</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html"><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></a> on your PC and import your image. Then, select the <strong>Background Eraser Tool</strong> in the Toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-the-background-eraser-tool-in-photoshop.png"                      alt="using the background eraser tool in photoshop"                ></p><p>Step2 Now, click and drag over the background area you want to erase. Photoshop will automatically select the area you want to erase as you drag.</p><p>Adjust the size and hardness of the eraser brush by using the <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> in the <strong>Options bar.</strong> Alternatively, you can also press the <strong>“Right Bracket (]) “</strong> button to increase the size of the brush and the <strong>“Left Bracket ([)”</strong> key to decrease it.</p><p>Step3 In the next step, set the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> to <strong>“Once”</strong> and <strong>“Limits”</strong> to <strong>“Contiguous.”</strong> This will help you avoid erasing the wrong pixel color and remove those positioned closer to each other.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-sampling-options-and-limits-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the sampling options and limits in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>However, if the pixels are positioned far apart from each other, you can set the <strong>“Limit”</strong> option to <strong>“Discontiguous.”</strong> While when erasing the pixels around the subject, set the <strong>“Limits”</strong> settings to <strong>“Find Edges”</strong> to ensure smooth edges.</p><p>Step4 If your image background and subject are of the same color and <strong>Photoshop</strong> it removing parts of your subject during the process, set the <strong>Tolerance</strong> to a <strong>low value</strong> by dragging its slider up or down or typing it in the box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-tolerance-value-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the tolerance value in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>Step5 When removing pixels from a background, you can preserve specific pixel colors from being removed, which can be helpful if they are close to the area you want to erase.</p><p>For this, place the cursor on the color you want to keep and press &amp; hold the <strong>ALT</strong> (Windows) or the <strong>Option</strong> key (Mac) until the brush changes to the Eyedropper Tool icon. Then, click the area to sample the color in the <strong>Foreground Swatch.</strong></p><p>This will protect the color, and Photoshop will now avoid erasing it while removing the background. You can repeat the process to preserve other pixels while removing the background.</p><p>Step6 Finally, after removing the background, you can place the subject on another image, a solid color, or export it as PNG with transparent BG.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/exporting-the-final-image-after-erasing-background-with-background-eraser.png"                      alt="exporting the final image after erasing background with background eraser"                ></p><h2 id="You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool"><a href="#You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool" class="headerlink" title="You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool"></a>You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned <strong>how to use the Background Eraser Tool in Photoshop.</strong> During the process of operating, you might wonder how the software works and changes the BG layer.</p><p>To help you understand this process, we’ll create a sample project (image with pink and blue strips) and show you how the tool works:</p><p>After importing the image, when we check the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel, we can see that the image is labeled as a <strong>“Background”</strong> layer. So now, we want to erase the pink column and keep the blue one to create a pattern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-image-layer-in-the-layers-panel.png"                      alt="checking the image layer in the layers panel"                ></p><p>When we select the Background Erase tool, the cursor changes to a brush that helps Photoshop to sample the colors that come under the <strong>crosshair (Plus)</strong> in the center of the circle. The circle around the crosshair shows the area where the software will erase the pixels (only the pixels with the same color or shades).</p><p>Now, to remove the pink stripes, we’ll move the brush to that part, and when clicked, the area under the circle will be erased. Notice that even if the circle moves to the blue area, it remains untouched because those pixels are not the same shade&#x2F;color.</p><p>Therefore, as long as we keep the crosshair within the pink area, Photoshop will only erase the pink pixels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-working-process-of-photo-shop.png"                      alt="checking the working process of photo shop"                ></p><p>However, if we accidentally erase the blue stripes, we can always go back by simply pressing the <strong>“CTRL+Z”</strong> in Windows and <strong>“Command+Z”</strong> in Mac. To undo multiple steps, hit the <strong>“Ctrl+Alt+Z” (Windows)</strong> or <strong>Command+Option+Z” (Mac)</strong> keys repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop"></a>Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop</h2><h3 id="1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible"><a href="#1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint. However, you may need some tweaking on PowerPoint to finally use the feature as you prepare your slides.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Windows"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Windows</strong></h3><p>Aside from the regular Cortana speech recognition on Windows, you can use the speech-to-text feature on PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports “speech-to-text” when you use the program; however, activating the Windows device through the <strong>built-in speech recognition</strong> makes the process easy and effective. Some windows PC, just like Mac, lets you first activate the speech recognition function before you proceed and use it on PowerPoint.</p><ul><li>On PowerPoint, click on the microphone icon on the left corner of your PowerPoint’s homepage. If the speech-to-text feature is not activated on your device, you can follow the instruction to activate it.

There are cases you need to activate speech-to-text in a life event. PowerPoint supports this through the “speech-to-text” feature available on the platform.</p><h3 id="Set-up-captions-and-subtitles"><a href="#Set-up-captions-and-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Set up captions and subtitles"></a><strong>Set up captions and subtitles</strong></h3><p>Real-time display and translation are suitable for the multi-language purpose. You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production.

Whether you’re landing a new job or creating content that inspires people, a good story can truly transform your output. Unfortunately, learning this process can take quite a bit of time as resources to understand it are not that readily available.</p><p>However, there are some great online academies that could bring your storytelling to a whole new level.

If you could include amazing stories in your discussion, then no matter in the field, your words will connect and even, in many cases, inspire others. These days our attention is divided into many forms, so it is not always easy to share ideas or influence others. However, if you know how to tell stories, then people will listen.</p><p>Let’s suppose that you’re informing your friends or family members about a hike that you did last summer. In this case, if you only told them about the raw details, then it’s more likely that they won’t be much interested.</p><p>When you put this information in a story’s context and apply its rules 9&#x2F;10 times, your details will be more engaging.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Strategies-for-Sustaining-Viewer-Interest-in-Online-Events"><a href="#Strategies-for-Sustaining-Viewer-Interest-in-Online-Events" class="headerlink" title="Strategies for Sustaining Viewer Interest in Online Events"></a>Strategies for Sustaining Viewer Interest in Online Events</h2><p>In today’s day and age, over 59% of all marketing agencies are live streaming their content for the most reach. That is pretty simple why they jump into the live streaming businesses. There are also lots of brands and content creators just getting started, basically learning how to live stream that run into complicated situations. How do you plan it? How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards. It allows people to stream high-quality livestreams and videos. It’s suitable for platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube and Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="nivdia shadowplay"                ></p><p>ShadowPlay’s DVR-style Instant Replay mode can be used by pressing a hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of your content to your hard drive or share to Twitch or YouTube. You can manually record videos for as long as you like because ShadowPlay is hardware accelerated. You can make up to a 15-second GIFs from your ShadowPlay video to ceate highlights, edit them afterwards with color grading effects, adding music, text, and upload it to Facebook, YouTube or Vimeo.</p><p><strong>XSplit Broadcaster</strong></p><p>XSplit Broadcaster is a recording and linve software for Windows. XSplit allows you to record and stream in 4K 60fps. You can use XSplit Broadcaster to stream on all platforms you can imagine that have a live function, you can even go live on multiple stream services at the same time. The streaming software has a lot of stream management features. There’s an option to edit scenes before starting your live stream with the Scene Preview Editor.</p><p>The ability to creative your own title and tags for ease of search is outstanding. The list of compatible technology that integrates with the software and the amount of data servers there are to help accommodate your needs while streaming, no matter if you are using ethernet or WiFi, XSplit is super easy to use for gaming, recording or podcasting.</p><p><strong>Wirecast</strong></p><p>What’s cool is that you can live stream from unlimited amount of sources. Microphones, cameras, IP cameras, and more. A built-in web-browser is able to show things such as web pages as well. You can mix up to 8 separate audio tracks and add processing combined with effects to enhance the viewer experience even more. Its powerful production capabilities make it super easy to switch back and forth between different live camera feeds while mixing in prerecorded video, graphics, audio, transitions and even slides.</p><p>Wirecast enables event organizers to comine live or pre-recorded video together with audio to achieve professional results as well as individual audio tracks for separate outputs. This program comes with a stock media library with videos, background images, music and more. Wirecast lets you stream like a pro and with its high-end features. This streaming software has multi-level audio recording, and 1-17 slot multi-viewer output for more advanced level of streaming and even ISO record assistance.</p><p><strong>VidBlasterX</strong></p><p>This is one of the high-end software systems with a built-in switcher and audio mixer. You can combine any number of floating input or output modules that can be positioned anywhere you want in the user interface. The modules can be docked to other ones to create the studio design that works best for you. It’s a huge benefit for having the most customization of all the 3rd party encoder apps you can use for live streaming.</p><p>The Home &amp; Studio editions comes with community support; the Broadcast edition comes with both priority and community support as well. The VidBlasterX Trial Edition is the same as the Studio Edition, with a watermark added to all output channels. The VidblasterX website tells: “VidBlasterX is a versatile and powerful ultra-low latency cascading vision mixer and video router with built-in scalers, time base correctors, frame synchronisers, IP video encoders and decoders, video players, recorders, keyers, effects and much more.”</p><p><strong>vMix</strong></p><p>This program also allows you to create professional quality videos and live shows. vMix offers you the power to add multiple cameras angles, images, videos, audio, titles, Powerpoint presentations, chroma key, virtual sets and even more than that. You are then able to showcase, live stream and record your content all at the same time. vMix integrates with EasyWorship, Flowplayer, Facebook, Restream, Vimeo, Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>That being said, vMix has excelled in great features and looks to be coming out with even more every six months. This program has added everything you need. Their integration of dedicated Call-In features together with NDI &amp; SRT support is clearly included and is available at a very affordable price. After all, we definitely recommend anyone wanting to move from a hardware solution to this kind of a software, to give vMix a try. Especially when they offer you a full 60-day Free Trial and it’s not a limited trial version either, but rather the whole top end version that includes everything you need to boost your live streaming career off the ground!</p><p><strong>Ffmpeg</strong></p><p>When talking about Ffmpeg, we’d like to mention that this is a very basic broadcasting software compatible with Dacast’s streaming platform. From what we noticed is that Ffmpeg is very easy and quick to learn where you won’t need to open another application in order to use it. As long as you’re happy with using the command line, you can use it for video and audio conversions, compression, and many other tools included in the options. We did use it to try at video editing, after using other paid software too, like VEGAS Pro. We do agree that it’s a matter of getting used to the program. You can find anything you need online to get started, or when you are lost. It’s good that it does not claim a lot of space on the hard drive. This is a complete new way of live streaming and video editing.</p><p><strong>Restream.io</strong></p><p>You likely have heard about this program. Restream is a complete and professional live streaming application for anyone who wants to start their online career professionally. Simply stream professional broadcasts from your browser to multiple social platforms at once, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. Customize your live streams, engage with your viewers, and drive action. They have a packed community of over 5,000,000 streamers using Restream to go broadcast live on YouTube, Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, and more!</p><p>The most significant of all features is the Ecamm Live integration. This allows you to read the chat of different platforms from the same place. The video quality that Restream employs is the best with barely any latency and delay!</p><h2 id="Wrapping-it-up"><a href="#Wrapping-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping it up"></a>Wrapping it up</h2><p>Live streaming is quite a wide topic, and each streaming experience is different as well. We made this article to give you a very neutral feel how to go live stream. Understanding the basics together with some test runs and practice will help make your live streams way more better and valuable for the viewers.</p><p><a class="link"

Being a photo text editor, you need to be careful about every element that is across the photo. Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:</p><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-Perspective"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Perspective"></a>1. Understanding the Perspective</h3><p>Adding text as a perspective is believed to be an inclusive way of providing viewers with the idea of the image and helping them understand it to the fullest. If you are looking forward to writing a text on photos,you can give your text a little angle and appearance according to the image shoot for a good illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-9.jpg"                      alt="understand image perspective"                ></p><h3 id="2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties"><a href="#2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties" class="headerlink" title="2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties"></a>2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties</h3><p>It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won’t tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-10.jpg"                      alt="blend text with image properties"                ></p><h3 id="3-Look-for-Negative-Space"><a href="#3-Look-for-Negative-Space" class="headerlink" title="3. Look for Negative Space"></a>3. Look for Negative Space</h3><p>When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering. Often referred to as negative space, utilizing that space for the text may be the perfect way that you can consider writing a text on photos. This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-11.jpg"                      alt="add text in negative space"                ></p><h3 id="4-Framing-the-Text"><a href="#4-Framing-the-Text" class="headerlink" title="4. Framing the Text"></a>4. Framing the Text</h3><p>If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-12.jpg"                      alt="frame the text"                ></p><h3 id="5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles"><a href="#5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles" class="headerlink" title="5. Control your Sizes and Styles"></a>5. Control your Sizes and Styles</h3><p>Make sure that you always select a font size or style that is relevant to the photo. The use of inappropriate sizes and styles in photos takes away the essence of the picture. A balance across these traits is essential for the user to bring. Capture the viewers’ attention without compromising the quality of the photo itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-13.jpg"                      alt="select accurate font size and style"                ></p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The best illustration of images is not possible without adding typography to them.

The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1.
