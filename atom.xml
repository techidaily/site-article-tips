It contains a wide range of basic video editing and enhancing features. There are two versions of the AndroVid App, a free one and a paid one known as AndroVid Pro.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> You can download <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androvid&hl=en&gl=US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Google Play.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> As discussed before, you can use AndroVid for free.

AndroVid doesn’t have any premium plugins either, but it does include an online asset shop for music, fonts, and other items that you can access more of by upgrading to Pro.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Key-features-of-AndroVid-Video-Editor-Maker"><a href="#Part-2-Key-features-of-AndroVid-Video-Editor-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Why should we use preset LUTs?</h2><p>In addition to supporting a video to connect with audiences and emphasize the plot, color is also the most natural method for viewers to perceive a piece of media.

Every video producer has to be able to accurately comprehend the emotional qualities of color in order to adapt to the specific color theme of the movie. However, a beginner frequently doesn’t know where to start when attempting color correction and color mixing for the first time. Color rings and color curves seem to be professional-level tools that are far beyond their reach. This time, a pre-set LUTs package will precisely solve the problem.</p><h2 id="Part-2-10-best-free-LUTs-with-download-links"><a href="#Part-2-10-best-free-LUTs-with-download-links" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 10 best free LUTs with download links"></a>Part 2. 10 best free LUTs with download links</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Red-LUT"><a href="#1-Red-LUT" class="headerlink" title="1.

Well, they use creative assets known as vector art. Although the term may sound alien to you, it is common within creative circles, especially among professionals who use editing software in post-production.</p><p>The following is an overview of what vector art entails and why you should consider it for your next project. In addition, you will also find recommendations for the best free vector art and graphics websites to source for creative assets. Keep reading to discover more.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Make-Good-Use-of-Vector-art" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?"></a>Part1: How to Make Good Use of Vector art?</h2><p>So, what is vector art? Vector art is a creative term to describe images and illustrations you can easily modify without compromising their quality. For example, you can resize vector graphics to fit a billboard print without pixelating the original file. In addition, creating vector art involves using mathematical algorithms to create visual images on software such as Draw and Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>Furthermore, vector art results from using geometrical shapes to create images on a coordinate system. Typically, you represent each image point using a pair of numerical coordinates to indicate their distance from two fixed perpendicular lines. In addition, both fixed lines use a similar unit of length to determine the distance. As such, your origin point will always represent by coordinates 0,0.</p><p>The following are the common terms that vector art creators use in their work:</p><ul><li>Point</li></ul><p>The term refers to an exact location in the creative space. In addition, a point does not have length, width, or thickness dimensions. Instead, you represent it using numerical coordinates on a cartesian plane. For example, coordinates 0,0 represent the origin point on a 2D creative plane.</p><ul><li>Line</li></ul><p>A line is a segment of the creative space bound by two endpoints. In addition, you can represent it as a closed line segment where you indicate both endpoints or an open line segment that excludes the endpoints.</p><ul><li>Curves</li></ul><p>Conversely, curves are non-straight segments of your creative space. In addition, you use them to trace moving points in your creative space. For example, creators use parabolas to represent curves in their vector art.</p><ul><li>Polygons</li></ul><p>These images on your creative space have a specific number of connecting endpoints. For example, a triangle is a polygon with three connecting endpoints. In addition, you can create self-intersecting polygons where the image boundary crosses over itself. Star polygons are the most common example of self-intersecting polygons.</p><p>Vector art is best for creative works in the following categories:</p><ul><li>Album Covers.</li><li>Movie Posters.</li><li>Video Games.</li><li>Printed Ads.</li><li>Branded merchandise that features your logo.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Free-vectors-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Free vectors websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what vector art entails, here is a list of the best free vector websites you should check out.

The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1. B roll In TV And Movies"></a>1. B roll In TV And Movies</h2><p>Broll is an acronym for “background” or “behind,” respectively. It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W. Griffith’s 1915 film “Intolerance.” Griffith’s creative application All of the shots that are used in a movie or television show are collectively referred to as “b roll footage.” To add context and complexity to the production being recorded, these shots are frequently seen on screen in quick succession.</p><p>B roll can be utilized for establishing shots as well as close-ups of items. It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods to use b roll"></a>2. Methods to use b roll</h2><p>Now that there are so many stock footage platforms, you have a lot of choices when you need just the right scene for your project. Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.

Visual detail b roll footage"></a>2. Visual detail b roll footage</h3><p>Including archival material in your video allows your audience to experience a previously covered or historically significant story as it occurred.

Storytelling b roll footage"></a>3. Storytelling b roll footage</h3><p>B roll footage can be used to tell a story that supports the narrative of your video. For example, in this video interview of Tom DeLonge, the speaker talks about living in a neighborhood. The B rolls show him driving around in his car, skateboarding on the street in the 90’s. These add to the story the video creator wants to talk about not seeing people with a disability differently.</p><h3 id="4-Undirected-b-roll-footage"><a href="#4-Undirected-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Undirected b roll footage"></a>4. Undirected b roll footage</h3><p>This particular kind of B roll film is captured without any direction being given to your character, as the name suggests. For the purposes of an interview video, for instance, these can be straightforward close-up views of your character’s hands and facial expressions. On the other hand, while you’re doing a documentary, you might record your subject participating in everyday activities.</p><h3 id="5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage"><a href="#5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="5.

Pick-up shots"></a>6. Pick-up shots</h3><p>A pick-up is a tiny shot added to previously captured material. Re-shoots involve redoing entire scenes. Both types of shots are commonly added during film editing to fix, logic, continuity, or quality flaws. These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7. A roll vs b roll"></a>7. A roll vs b roll</h3><p>Imagine the A roll as part of the video’s story. This could be a documentary film, news show, or scripted sketch. Everything else on your editing table must be rearranged to fit it. When the speaker in the following video is directly talking to the camera or interviewer, this is A roll footage.

Microsoft Teams, a platform for corporate collaboration, is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams provides file storage, application integration, workplace chat, and videoconferencing.

With that in mind, we’ve compiled this guide to explain How to Zoom in Teams among the other features that would be helpful as a Team user.</p><p>Through Teams, users may talk with one another. Users do not need to check a discussion history since conversations on Teams are permanent, in contrast to Skype for Business. In conversations, users may format text and include emoticons. The user may designate a communication as urgent or important. Communications regarded as important have a red symbol. Along with real-time communications, Teams users may collaborate on documents. Microsoft has a considerable competitive edge over competitors as you can learn How to Zoom out in Microsoft Teams. Follow the guide below to learn how to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="zoom microsoft teams"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams"></a>Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams</h2><p>By visiting a certain online address or receiving an invitation from the team administrator, communities, organizations, or teams may join Teams.

The goal of this group of technologies is to raise employee productivity. On-screen zooming and camera zooming for meetings are the two types of zoom functionality that Microsoft Teams users are most interested in. The user interface can be zoomed in since it is natively supported, however the camera cannot be zoomed in without the use of third-party software.</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Teams does not provide native camera controls. A camera-controlling app with zoom-in&#x2F;zoom-out features would be necessary. You may try YouCam for that. YouCam Perfect’s new image-enhancing features enable you to create magazine-quality portraits from your selfies. The program comes in two versions, one of which is free and the other is a paid version.</p><p>YouCam is a program intended to control and use webcams. The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful. The free version comes with the basic zoom in&#x2F;out capabilities, but it also has sceneries, emoticons, and filters. Other unique features of the YouCam Perfect program include an immediate beautifier, a tool to improve skin tone, a physique enhancer, a collage builder, and a social network as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/youcam-zoom-camera.jpg"                      alt="youcam zoom camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam"><a href="#Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:"></a><strong>Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:</strong></h3><p>The process to enabling CyberLink YouCam will vary depending on the sort of instant messaging program you are using. You may do the following steps to set up your camera to zoom in for an online meeting:</p><p>Step1The first step is to install YouCam on your computer. YouCam is available for both Windows and Mac. After installation, you may launch YouCam and provide it access to your laptop’s camera or Windows webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launch-youcam-application.jpg"                      alt="launch youcam application"                ></p><p>Step2In the next step, there is a narrow bar on the right side of the Settings screen, enable the Video zoom and afterwards, in the zooming bar, you can use it to zoom in and out with the help of the cursor as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-video-zoom-youcam.jpg"                      alt="enable video zoom youcam"                ></p><p>Step3You may enlarge the image as much as you wish before returning to the team’s tab or window.

If you have completed the YouCam settings, there will be an option of YouCam, as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-devices-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="click devices microsoft teams"                ></p><p>Step5The camera will already be zoomed in or out, based on your choice, when you start the meeting.

This is because the default preview window of most editors can be too small to show all the flaws in your clips. For example, you may have missed a spot during the color correction, which you would have missed when using normal view. However, accessing the function varies with the software and your device’s operating system. Here is how to access premiere pro full screen preview from different devices.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?"></a>Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is one of a videographer’s best video editing software. This is because it offers you one of the largest libraries of creative and editing assets. Furthermore, you can work cross-platform through the Creative Clouds service.</p><p>Unfortunately, this becomes challenging for Windows and macOS users because of the operation difference between their devices. For example, the key names differ on each device’s keyboard. Windows Keyboards feature the CTRL key, and Apple offers the COMMAND key instead. As such, it is challenging to locate functions with HOTKEYS.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to access Premiere full screen preview on both devices.</p><h3 id="Windows-Users"><a href="#Windows-Users" class="headerlink" title="Windows Users"></a><strong>Windows Users</strong></h3><ol><li>Launch Adobe Premiere Pro from your device and open your project file.</li><li>Once all the clips load on their tracks, you begin editing with the suite of creative assets from the program library. Some of the edits you can do include applying color LUTS and green screen.</li><li>Then, tap the <strong>Play</strong> button or the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> key on your keyboard to preview your work.</li><li>To enable a large screen preview, press the Grave Key (represent by <strong>~</strong> on a Windows keyboard. Also it shares the key with `) to enlarge the preview window.</li><li>To activate Premier Pro full screen preview, just tab the same key while pressing Ctrl. In addition, the HOT KEY shortcut works with every video clip you want to preview.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-2.jpg"                      alt="tab the same key"                ></p><ol><li>Finally, you deactivate the function by pressing <strong>CTRL</strong> and <strong>~</strong> to return to the normal screen.</li></ol><h3 id="macOS-Users"><a href="#macOS-Users" class="headerlink" title="macOS Users"></a><strong>macOS Users</strong></h3><p>The process for macOS users is similar to the above. However, you will notice a difference in the HOT KEYS shortcuts.</p><ol><li>Launch the program and click on the Open Project option to access your project. Alternatively, you can directly access the program by clicking the project file on your storage device.</li><li>Then, select the clip you want to preview and hit the SPACEBAR to play the video. You can also activate play by clicking the Play button from your monitor panel.</li><li>To enable a full screen preview, simply <strong>press Control Key</strong> (represented by a ^ on the Mac keyboard) while tapping the <strong>Grave Key (represented by a ‘)</strong> on your keyboard to activate the Premiere full screen preview. In addition, you can deactivate it by hitting the combination again. It’s quite easy to reach with only the left hand.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-3.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135409/19272" target="_top" id="2135409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135409/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Pro tips: If you still find the combination complex, here’s how to change it:</p><p>First, click “Premiere Pro” on the top menu, and choose Keyboard Shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-4.jpg"                      alt="premiere pro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087408/7443" target="_top" id="2087408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Then, search for “Full” and you will see the defult shortcut.

Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature"></a>2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature</h3><p>Another reason for full screen preview lag is Mercury Transmit. The feature allows you to transmit your video to a secondary screen. However, it takes up valuable RAM, especially when you do not own a second monitor. Here is how to disable it.</p><ul><li>Open your program settings and proceed to the <strong>Playback</strong></li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Enable Mercury Transmit</strong> option in the resulting menu.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software"><a href="#3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software" class="headerlink" title="3. Always update your system hardware and software"></a>3. Always update your system hardware and software</h3><p>Sometimes your full screen previews may lag because you miss the latest updates. Typically, developers provide users with free regular updates to make their software run better. For example, Adobe Premiere Pro issues regular updates to fix bugs and provide you with more creative library content.</p><p>As such, ensure you have the <strong>Check For Updates</strong> function enabled in your programs. Kindly note the feature only works if your device has an active internet connection.</p><h3 id="4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution"><a href="#4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution" class="headerlink" title="4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution"></a>4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution</h3><p>It is not wrong wanting to preview your video at 4K resolution. However, this can cause the program to lag significantly, especially if your device has low specs. In addition, changing your preview’s playback resolution does not affect its export settings. Follow these steps to make the changes:</p><ul><li>Access the <strong>Playback Resolution</strong> menu of your video clip from the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Then, alternate between lower values until the video lag stops. Currently, you can lower your Premiere full screen preview playback resolution up to 1&#x2F;16 the original value.</li></ul><h2 id="Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?"></a>Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-6.jpg"                      alt="best alternative to premiere pro"                ></p><p>So, you have given up on Premiere Pro’s persistent problems.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Cutting-Edge-Desktops-for-Modern-Workspaces"><a href="#Cutting-Edge-Desktops-for-Modern-Workspaces" class="headerlink" title="Cutting-Edge Desktops for Modern Workspaces"></a>Cutting-Edge Desktops for Modern Workspaces</h2><p>The designs of swanky, cutting-edge laptops are always changing. Smartphones are incredibly versatile and</p><p>widely used. Where does that leave the desktop PC, a relic of the 1980s? There are still a ton of options</p><p>available, and the desktop market is constantly innovating, particularly regarding all-in-one and small-</p><p>form-factor devices. But many customers appear to view desktop computers as an antique, since they</p><p>immediately walk to the laptop aisle when making their next computer purchase.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Corsair One i300</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Lenovo Yoga A940</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Azulle Access4</a></li><li><a href="#part2-6">Alienware Aurora R13</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much CPU power do you need</a></li><li><a href="#part4">What graphics card do you need</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What desktops are recommended?"></a>Part 2. What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5" class="headerlink" title="1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5"></a>1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</h3><p>Even so, there are times when you just want the best of the best, the absolute cream of the crop. It won’t be</p><p>for everyone, of course. That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for. Of course, the</p><p>majority of these models will set you back a good coin, but if performance is what you’re after, look no further.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087248/19272" target="_top" id="2087248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087248/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Corsair-One-i300"><a href="#2-Corsair-One-i300" class="headerlink" title="2. Corsair One i300"></a>2. Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020" class="headerlink" title="3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)"></a>3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen.

What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money?

If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills.

How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for.

It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!).

The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1061528/11832" target="_top" id="1061528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1061528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1061528/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal.

If you’re in such a situation, you could convert the SRT file to another format that’s compatible with the app you’re using. I know the question on your mind right now is “How do I convert SRT file?” Well, that’s why we’ve created this guide.</p><p>Here, we’ve discussed the most reliable methods to convert SRT to XML, SSA, TTML, and other different formats. So, what are you waiting for? Scroll down to find out how to convert SRT without stress.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Which-Platforms-support-SRT-files"><a href="#Part-1-Which-Platforms-support-SRT-files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Which Platforms support SRT files?"></a>Part 1: Which Platforms support SRT files?</h2><p>Before we discuss how to convert SRT to VTT, XML, TTML or any other format, it’ll be fair for us to know different social media and video platforms support what kind of subtitle formats to prevent future mistakes of opening VTT files on platforms that do not support VTT.</p><p>Below is a table displaying the different platforms that support what kind of subtitle files</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Media Platform</strong></th><th><strong>Subtitle Formats Supported</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td>SubRip (.srt), Cheetah, CAP (.cap), WebVTT (.vtt), Timed Text (.ttml)</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>SubRip (.srt)</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>SubRip (.srt)</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>automatic captioning</td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td>WebVTT (.vtt), SubRip (.srt), Timed Text (.ttml), Scenarist (.scc)</td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td>SubRip (.srt)</td></tr><tr><td>Filmora</td><td>SubRip (.srt)</td></tr><tr><td>VLC</td><td>SubRip (.srt)</td></tr><tr><td>Final Cut Pro</td><td>Scenarist (.scc)</td></tr><tr><td>Premiere pro</td><td>Scenarist (.scc), MacCaption (.mcc), Timed Text (.ttml)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now that we’ve already known platform subtitle compatibility, let’s dive into the main discussion without wasting much of your time.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-XML"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-XML" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Convert SRT to XML"></a>Part 2: How to Convert SRT to XML</h2><p>Irrespective of the reason why you want to convert SRT to XML, the best way to get the job done is to use an online tool. Yes, this is because XML is a markup language based on Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), and you will require technical knowledge to understand files in such formats. The file format allows the sharing of structured information between two different programs, programs, and people, or among locally and shared networks.</p><p>The question is which online tool can convert SRT to XML? GoTranscript is the perfect SRT to XML converter that you need for this operation. This tool allows a straightforward SRT to XML conversion, and all it takes is just a few clicks. Read on to learn how to use the tool to convert SRT to XML.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter" >GoTranscript Subtitle Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-1.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to xml"                ></p><p>Step3 Select the file output format as “Flash XML (.xml)”. Then hit the “Convert” button to convert SRT to XML.</p><p>After the conversion process is finalized, you can download the XML file to your PC.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-SSA"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-SSA" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Convert SRT to SSA"></a>Part 3: How to Convert SRT to SSA</h2><p>Are you looking to convert SRT to SSA? SSA is a more advanced subtitle file format, and it’s usually used in anime fansubs to either store subtitle data with video or to overlay subtitles on video while it’s being encoded. The subtitle is not really popular among video content creators. However, when the need to convert SRT to SSA arises, an online tool is the right solution to help you get the job done without error. And luckily, the prior mentioned GoTranscipt subtitle converter also supports such a conversion process.</p><p>The steps below explain the process.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-ssa" >ToolSlick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-2.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step3 Click Convert to begin SRT to SSA conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-3.jpg"                      alt="click convert to begin srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, click the green Download icon to download the converted file to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-4.jpg"                      alt="clcik the green download icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML"></a>Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML</h2><p>Formerly known as DFXP (Distribution Format Exchange Profile), TTML (Time Texture Markup Language) is a time text in online media used in authoring, transcoding, or exchanging time text information used for subtitles and captions of videos. Although this format is supported in most media players, it cannot be used in web browsers. However, some people still have personal reasons why they want to convert SRT to TTML. Irrespective of what your reason to convert SRT to TTML is, you need the help of an online tool to carry out the operation.</p><p>We used the Better Converter online tool to convert SRT to TTML here. Just follow the following steps to perform the task.</p><p>Step1 Open <a class="link"   href="https://www.better-converter.com/Subtitles-Converter/Str-to-TTML-Subtitle-Converter" >Better Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your browser.</p><p>Step2 Use the Browse button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-5.jpg"                      alt="use browse to upload srt file"                ></p><p>Step3 Once you upload the file, Better Converter will automatically convert it to TTML and download the file to your PC.

But first, what is SCC? SCC (Scenarist Closed Captions) is a closed caption file that is used as a sidecar file in video editing and production programs. Such programs use it in saving unrendered videos before exporting them to the final video format. Unlike SRT, this type of file format can only be opened in certain applications as it’s not a universally accepted format.</p><p>To convert SRT to SCC, you need an online converter, and here, we’ve explained the step-by-step process to convert SRT to SCC using REV online converter. It’s a reliable tool for the job.</p><p>Step1 Visit REV’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.rev.com/captionconverter" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click on Select.SRT Files to upload the SRT file you want to convert to SCC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-6.jpg"                      alt="click on select srt files"                ></p><p>Step3 Under Select Output Formats, choose Scenarist (.scc).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-7.jpg"                      alt="choose scenarist"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/977686/11832" target="_top" id="977686">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-977686" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/977686/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step4 Enter your email into the relevant box and click the Convert button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-8.jpg"                      alt="enter email into relevant box"                ></p><p>The SRT file should be converted within a few minutes.

So, if you’re looking to convert SRT to FCPXML, you also need an online tool. Although the online tool that converts SRT to FCPXML is very limited, the Resolver Tool is one that does the job correctly. However, it only works efficiently with PC. So, we advise you use a PC for this operation.</p><p>See the steps to perform the task below:</p><p>Step1 Open Resolver Tools in your PC browser.</p><p>Step2 Click on Choose File to upload the SRT file you want to convert.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-9.jpg"                      alt="click on choose file to upload"                ></p><p>Step3 Select FCPXML to SRT 1.5 and edit output as per requirement.

The subtitle is not really popular among video content creators. However, when the need to convert SRT to SSA arises, an online tool is the right solution to help you get the job done without error. And luckily, the prior mentioned GoTranscipt subtitle converter also supports such a conversion process.</p><p>The steps below explain the process.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-ssa" >ToolSlick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-2.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step3 Click Convert to begin SRT to SSA conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-3.jpg"                      alt="click convert to begin srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, click the green Download icon to download the converted file to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-4.jpg"                      alt="clcik the green download icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML"></a>Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML</h2><p>Formerly known as DFXP (Distribution Format Exchange Profile), TTML (Time Texture Markup Language) is a time text in online media used in authoring, transcoding, or exchanging time text information used for subtitles and captions of videos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Teacher’s-Guide-To-Use-Video-In-Teaching"><a href="#Teacher’s-Guide-To-Use-Video-In-Teaching" class="headerlink" title="Teacher’s Guide To Use Video In Teaching"></a>Teacher’s Guide To Use Video In Teaching</h2><p>The use of videos in online classrooms or classes is a very much researched topic that has greatly benefited many students. Students and teachers all agree on using video as a teaching tool. The availability of free and high-quality videos online also makes the perfect addition to mixed learning environments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-lecture.jpg"                      alt="video lecture"                ></p><p>Due to the pandemic, we can’t go back to school and teach our students face-to-face; the best option we need to do is to show create and personalized video for the class. Of course, as teachers, we also need the creativity to do the videos for our students.</p><p>Video in education can help the Teachers and Students as well.</p><ul><li>Teachers can find, share, and use some videos that someone else has made.</li><li>Teachers can create their videos using a camera, phone, or maybe a screencast.</li><li>Teachers can host a video conference for the class and the school.</li><li>Knowing how the teacher discusses the lesson allows the students to create their videos.</li></ul><p>The two options for sharing videos with your students are synchronous or asynchronous.</p><p><strong>Synchronous Videos -</strong> it could be a live stream or an interactive video conference. It depends on the school if they want to use Zoom or Google Meet for their classes. We can record synchronous videos for the students so they can view them later if they request. It is helpful and valuable for the students if they can’t attend the live stream or, we can say, online class because of technical issues or important events they need to follow.</p><p>Some schools find that synchronous videos are a great way to keep the students connected. But there’s a problem with privacy issues nowadays, especially with the students if they are shown in synchronous videos and recorded. Make sure you need the student’s permission to record the video. We don’t also forget the internet connection issues of some students. Don’t forget and take note of that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/synchronous-videos-lecture.jpg"                      alt="synchronous videos lecture"                ></p><p><strong>Asynchronous Videos -</strong> you need to record videos that can be viewed and reviewed by the students. Your videos could be a recorded activity using a mobile phone or a screencast for them to know the lesson on that day. Screencasting is where you narrate a video recording or explain the task to your students using your computer screen. It’s up to the teacher if they want to use audio, or you can also see your face in the video.</p><p>Asynchronous learning can be more convenient for the students and allows them to learn anytime they want and place wherever they are. It can also be challenging for teachers to know whether students watched the videos or engaged with the work. We don’t know if the students watched the videos or learned something in the videos. So, double-check it, teacher time to time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-video-class.jpg"                      alt="online video class"                ></p><p>Using videos in online classes or classrooms has many benefits and can be adapted for any learning objective. You might find it helpful to use synchronous and asynchronous videos simultaneously. Research continues to provide more insights on how to better utilize video in online classes or classrooms.</p><h2 id="Different-ways-to-use-video-in-Online-Classes"><a href="#Different-ways-to-use-video-in-Online-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Different ways to use video in Online Classes"></a>Different ways to use video in Online Classes</h2><p><strong>Keep your videos short</strong></p><p>More effective if the videos you created are shorter. 12 to 15 minutes is the maximum time for the higher students (high school level) and 8 to 10 minutes for the younger students (elementary level). So, try to keep your videos as short as possible while addressing the central concept of the lesson. If you want to use a longer video, break it into smaller segments. Explain to the students the topics and the sub-topics of the lessons. You can divide it into the number of days you need to discuss that lesson.</p><p><strong>Choose suitable videos</strong></p><p>Some video elements are there to entertain and serve no educational purposes. Just avoid the videos with a noise like bells, whistles, or any background music to distract the students from the point of learning. Double-check everything you put into your video to ensure that it is suitable for the ears of the students.</p><p><strong>Video Watching with the students</strong></p><p>Thanks to YouTube, we have to find some content to add to our lessons and become part of the learning sequences of our classes. Add at least just 5 minutes to make sure your class time is not compromised. This type of learning will help the students before, during, or even after watching the videos, leading to outstanding learning outcomes.</p><p>Some activities will help the students to correct their overconfidence about how much they have learned from watching a video. You can add some pop-up questions throughout a video or give them an old-fashioned way, giving quizzes after watching the video to improve their learning.</p><p><strong>Watch on Individual Screens</strong></p><p>According to my research, most teachers like using a shared screen, and this will be beneficial for starting conversations, group learning exercises, and experience sharing. The students can view and learn something from the video at their homes. The students also have an advantage because they can view the video at their own pace, pause it when they want to go somewhere, or move it forwards and backward to the parts of the footage they need to hear again. This video is a way to help them manage the lesson flow so they can take some notes about it or complete the assignments and activities without missing anything.</p><p>Video has been an effective instructional tool for teachers with a track record of improving students’ learning. Today, we are leading the way toward increased reliance on video in the classroom. Video is being creatively used for learning by both teachers and students. Soon, video usage will likely increase even more. A major contributor to this expansion is the increased accessibility of technology and better internet connectivity.</p><p>More and more research supporting the advantages of blended learning will support video usage. Students will be able to benefit the most from this revolutionary trend as schools set themselves up to promote multimedia learning by carefully evaluating hardware audio along with image quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-exploring-samsungs-photo-enhancing-tools-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring Samsung’s Photo Enhancing Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-steps-for-initiating-a-social-media-charity-drive/"><u>[New] Steps for Initiating a Social Media Charity Drive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-strategies-for-sustainable-brand-collaboration-with-youtubers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Strategies for Sustainable Brand Collaboration with YouTubers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-art-of-blending-digital-canvases/"><u>[New] The Art of Blending Digital Canvases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-image-clarity-techniques-for-online-cropping-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Image Clarity Techniques for Online Cropping for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-best-free-platforms-for-unique-and-striking-text-appeal/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Best Free Platforms for Unique and Striking Text Appeal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-9gag-a-guide-for-memetic-creation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering 9GAG A Guide for Memetic Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-clip-connoisseurs-essential-list-of-retro-vhs-effects/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Clip Connoisseur's Essential List of Retro VHS Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dissecting-video-production-mastery-with-xmedia-studio-suite/"><u>2024 Approved Dissecting Video Production Mastery with XMedia Studio Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-pitch-to-peak-steps-for-effective-adobe-audition-fades/"><u>2024 Approved From Pitch to Peak Steps for Effective Adobe Audition Fades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixing-compatibility-problems-between-corsair-icue-and-windows-nx-update/"><u>Fixing Compatibility Problems Between Corsair iCUE and Windows nX Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-erase-an-apple-iphone-8-plus-without-apple-id-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Erase an Apple iPhone 8 Plus Without Apple ID Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-old-call-logs-from-your-vivo-y100-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>How to recover old call logs from your Vivo Y100 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-xiaomi-redmi-13c-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G Without PUK Codes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-playlist-passport-traveling-tunes-throughout-platforms/"><u>In 2024, Playlist Passport Traveling Tunes Throughout Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/1722890451545-is-your-zoom-experience-compromised-by-user-error-lets-find-out/"><u>Is Your Zoom Experience Compromised by User Error?

AR Stands for augmented reality - a technology that combines the real world and digital content. You can use it to make fun images and videos. But how do you use this feature? And are there options for people without a Google Pixel phone?</p><p>In this article, we will take a look at this feature. Also, we will show you a great alternative that lets you experience the same but using other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-its-alternative.gif"                      alt="google ar stickers and its alternative"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#What-Is-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="What Is Google AR Sticker?"></a>What Is Google AR Sticker?</h2><p>Think of stickers that you can put on images or videos. However, these stickers are in 3D. Furthermore, they look like they are actually in the environment or they are a part of your body. However, you can only see them through a camera lens.</p><p>You can look at Pokemon Go to understand it better. The game allows you to “place” your Pokemon in the real world and take photos of them. Google AR stickers are like that, except the stickers are not strictly only Pokemon. There are letters, food, Stranger Things characters, and more!</p><h2 id="History-of-Google-AR-Sticker"><a href="#History-of-Google-AR-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="History of Google AR Sticker"></a>History of Google AR Sticker</h2><p>Back in 2017, virtual reality and augmented reality received an increase in interest. While these technologies weren’t really new, it was at this time that they became common. Apps like Snapchat included AR stickers that allowed users to take photos and videos with their favorite fictional characters and such. Google hopped on the trend by incorporating AR stickers into its smartphone, Pixel 2.</p><p>The thing is that it did not last long. Ever since Google launched its Pixel 4a in 2020, they no longer provided AR stickers. The camera of the new devices is not compatible with AR stickers, Playground, and Playmoji. And that’s the end of Google AR Stickers.</p><p>Owners of older Pixel models should not worry since the devices’ hardware isn’t changed. Thus, they will continue to support Playground, the app needed to use Google AR Stickers.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier"><a href="#How-To-Use-Google-Playground-AR-Stickers-on-Pixel-4-and-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier"></a>How To Use Google Playground AR Stickers on Pixel 4 and Earlier</h2><p>As mentioned above, older Pixel models still have Google Playground support. These devices are Pixel 4 and earlier. Meanwhile, Playmojis (3D AR Stickers) are available only for Pixel 3, 3a, and 4.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this feature:</p><p>Step1 Ensure you have Android 8.1 (Oreo) installed on your Pixel. Also, ensure the Google Camera app is updated.</p><p>Step2 Launch the Google Camera app.</p><p>Step3 Tap **”**More” &gt; “Playground.”</p><p>Step4 Select “Stickers” &gt; “Playmoji” or “Stickers.”</p><p>Step5 Tap the AR Sticker or Playmoji that you want to use.</p><p>Step6 Touch and hold, and drag the AR sticker where you want it to be on the photo or video. Adjust the sticker as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-ar-stickers-6.jpg"                      alt="dragging star wars sticker to camera screen"                ></p><p>Step7 Tap “Capture” to take a photo. If in video mode, touch and hold “Capture” instead.</p><h2 id="Filmora-AR-Camera-–-Great-Alternative-to-Google-AR-Stickers"><a href="#Filmora-AR-Camera-–-Great-Alternative-to-Google-AR-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="Filmora AR Camera – Great Alternative to Google AR Stickers"></a>Filmora AR Camera – Great Alternative to Google AR Stickers</h2><p>Suppose you own a Google Pixel 4a or a later model, and you want to try augmented reality photos and videos. Sadly, you can’t use Google’s own AR stickers. But don’t worry. There’s a great alternative! You can use Filmora AR Camera on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Mobile instead.

It lets you take photos and videos with virtual characters. Also, you can add digital content (a helmet on your head, for example) to your photo to enhance it. You also don’t have to be in the frame to use Filmora for Mobile’s AR stickers.

Filmora for Mobile will automatically combine and arrange them.</p><h2 id="Use-Filmora-AR-Camera-To-Record-a-Video"><a href="#Use-Filmora-AR-Camera-To-Record-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora AR Camera To Record a Video"></a>Use Filmora AR Camera To Record a Video</h2><p>Here’s a tutorial on how to record an AR video &amp; how to edit an AR selfie video on iPhone.</p><h3 id="To-Record-an-AR-Video"><a href="#To-Record-an-AR-Video" class="headerlink" title="To Record an AR Video"></a>To Record an AR Video</h3><p>Step1 Install Filmora for Mobile from the App store.</p><p>Step2 Tap the “Camera” button on the right panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmorago/article-image/camera-icon-on-filmorago.jpg"                      alt="ar camera option on filmora iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Tap the “Frame” icon at the top right to adjust the video ratio.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.</p><p>Let’s suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording.

It’s understandable since “augmented reality” sounds very advanced and complex. Here are some FAQs about it to make you more informed about the subject.</p><p><strong>Q1. What Are AR Stickers?</strong></p><p>AR stickers are augmented reality image effects you can add to improve photos or videos. They can be static images or animations. Some examples are eyeglasses, bunny headbands, hats, beards, or even animals or characters.</p><p>The application that offers it maps your face or the environment in the video and tracks movements. With that, they make it seem like the AR sticker is real instead of a virtual object.</p><p>Let’s suppose you added AR eyeglasses to the video you are recording. When you move, the eyeglasses will follow your eyes instead of staying where they originally were.</p><p><strong>Q2. Can You Use AR Without an App?</strong></p><p>Perhaps you don’t want to install custom AR apps. That’s not new. According to some studies, engagement drops by 50% when users need to download. So, some developers chose the WebAR path instead.</p><p>WebAR uses web technologies to let users experience augmented reality. All you need is a phone or any device with a camera and a web browser. Since most modern browsers and operating systems already support AR, WebAR makes the experience so accessible.</p><p><strong>Q3. Are AR Apps Safe?</strong></p><p>AR Apps can be dangerous, but not all of them are. Keep in mind that AR apps can see what you are doing in real-time. If that information falls into the wrong hands, you may end up in trouble.</p><p>Vendors can also add malware or other things to the apps. So it’s necessary that you always stay vigilant. As much as possible, download AR apps from vendors with a good reputation. That’s how you ensure the app is not doing something nasty behind your back.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Google AR Stickers are great for enhancing your photos and videos.
