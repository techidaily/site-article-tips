    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Syncopating-Songs-Implementing-Fades-in-Logic-Pro-X"><a href="#Syncopating-Songs-Implementing-Fades-in-Logic-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Syncopating Songs: Implementing Fades in Logic Pro X"></a>Syncopating Songs: Implementing Fades in Logic Pro X</h2><p>Being a top-notch editor, you’d anticipate the cross-fade Logic Pro to perform at its highest level as Logic has added more and more features. Music industry experts may create and edit dynamic audio tracks utilizing step-sequencing, multi-device editing, and live looping features with the help of the Logic Pro crossfades and full audio editing features it offers. Modern synthesizers, retro gear, and intricate multi-sampled instruments are just a few of the plugins and sounds that are included with Logic Pro X.</p><p>One of Apple’s hidden crown jewels for a number of years now has been the music creation program Logic Pro X. Logic Pro keeps becoming better and better. Fades make it easier to segue between different parts of a composition or between different track components. Audio and MIDI zones in the workspace may be faded in or out in a number of ways in Logic Pro X. Find out the detailed steps to Logic Pro crossfade in the upcoming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Logic-Pro-X"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Logic-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Crossfade Audio in Logic Pro X"></a>Part 1. Steps to Crossfade Audio in Logic Pro X</h2><p>Users of any iOS device may control audio filters, mix multiple tracks, and play built-in software instruments using the Logic Remote feature. The fastest method to do a fade in or fade out is to use the fade tool on a loop, sample, recording, or whole track. The fade tool can currently only be used with audio regions, however utilizing this technique, a fade may be swiftly created in only a few seconds.</p><h5 id="Step1-Create-two-tracks"><a href="#Step1-Create-two-tracks" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create two tracks"></a>Step1 Create two tracks</h5><p>Your audio files should be imported into two new stereo Audio Tracks that you create in the Arrange section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-two-tracks-logic-prox.jpg"                      alt="create two tracks logic prox"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Connect-Two-Audio-Regions"><a href="#Step2-Connect-Two-Audio-Regions" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Connect Two Audio Regions"></a>Step2 Connect Two Audio Regions</h5><p>On the grid, place two audio areas next to one another. Crossfading may be used with two entirely different audio regions or a duplication of a single audio region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/connect-two-audio-regions-prox.jpg"                      alt="connect two audio regions prox"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Choose-the-Fade-Tool"><a href="#Step3-Choose-the-Fade-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Choose the Fade Tool"></a>Step3 Choose the Fade Tool</h5><p>You will choose every region on a track when you browse to it in the track header section. If the music contains numerous regions, you should choose the first area to deal with as executing a cross-fade requires you to first pick the regions you’d want to have the fade effect. Select the Fade Tool from the drop-down option for the Left-Click Tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-fade-tool-logic-prox.jpg"                      alt="change fade tool logic prox"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Create-a-crossfade"><a href="#Step4-Create-a-crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create a crossfade"></a>Step4 Create a crossfade</h5><p>Although it works as intended, moving the volume fader on one of the channel strips to switch between two recordings is not really enjoyable. Let’s make the crossfader larger.</p><p><strong>New &gt; Horizontal 4; Fader</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-crossfade-logic-prox.jpg"                      alt="create crossfade logic prox"                ></p><p>You now have total discretion over the fader’s look. Changing it afterwards is always an option; just choose the appropriate Style in the Inspector.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Crossfade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Crossfade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Alternative Way to Crossfade Audio"></a>Part 2. Alternative Way to Crossfade Audio</h2><p>Once adjusted, you may listen to your music library in a new manner; but, with Logic Pro X, it’s rather a laborious effort to do so. This audio mixing approach instantly improves the way your music collection is played seem more professional and makes listening to it more enjoyable. So, to crossfade Logic recordings, we advise utilizing <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. At a fraction of the price of powerful digital audio workstations like Pro Tools, Filmora delivers virtually all the functionality and versatility, if not the usability or aesthetic appeal.</p><p>It’s difficult to go wrong with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> whether you’re seeking to start podcasting or recording music.

Everything from clipping and chopping audio clips to adding special effects and recording sound is possible with this application. Additionally, using Filmora is very easy.

To accomplish this, either click on the desktop icon or enter “Filmora” into the desktop search box. After the program has successfully started, you must choose the Video Editor option. The next step involves importing the files on which you want to utilize the audio transition.

These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting.

You can use it to adjust your videos and photos from the comfort of your palms. It comprises these features.</p><p><strong>Basic color adjustment:</strong> This feature allows you to change your video or image color to your satisfaction. You can make it brighter or dull by moving the brightness bar to either the left or the right. Other adjustments are the contrast, saturation, and white balance.</p><p><strong>Choose your photos from the gallery:</strong> you don’t have to search for your data from other platforms. Simply choose photos or videos to use from the gallery. This applies to the earlier saved photos. However, you can also use your camera to shoot instant photos.</p><p><strong>Color correction:</strong> your image color could be too bright or dull. This feature enables you to correct the color to a perfect tone. Besides, you get to choose from a wide range of colors, or better still, do a quick mix even as you correct the needed sections.</p><p>You don’t intend to compose your video and miss an open platform to share your content.

It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works-1"><a href="#How-it-works-1" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks-1"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks-1" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting.

It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works-2"><a href="#How-it-works-2" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks-2"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks-2" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting.

You can use it to adjust your videos and photos from the comfort of your palms. It comprises these features.</p><p><strong>Basic color adjustment:</strong> This feature allows you to change your video or image color to your satisfaction. You can make it brighter or dull by moving the brightness bar to either the left or the right. Other adjustments are the contrast, saturation, and white balance.</p><p><strong>Choose your photos from the gallery:</strong> you don’t have to search for your data from other platforms. Simply choose photos or videos to use from the gallery. This applies to the earlier saved photos. However, you can also use your camera to shoot instant photos.</p><p><strong>Color correction:</strong> your image color could be too bright or dull. This feature enables you to correct the color to a perfect tone. Besides, you get to choose from a wide range of colors, or better still, do a quick mix even as you correct the needed sections.</p><p>You don’t intend to compose your video and miss an open platform to share your content. Use the export tab to instantly share your video or images once ed to perfection. You can use it for marketing or tutorials.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-3D-LUT-desktop-version-3"><a href="#The-3D-LUT-desktop-version-3" class="headerlink" title="The 3D LUT desktop version"></a>The 3D LUT desktop version</h3><p>The desktop version is the most widely used. It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works-3"><a href="#How-it-works-3" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks-3"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks-3" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting. It gives a different approach to several common photo editors on the market. You get the 3D LUT mobile app version and the desktop version. It also brings you tons of tools to pull through any piece of colorwork on your images and videos. However, working with this program is complex and may suit only professional photographers and editors.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

It’s up to you to decide everything about the podcast, like the episode’s length, topics, and more.</p><p>In this article, we’ll break down some of the things you want to consider before starting your solo podcast, so stick to the end.</p><ol><li><a href="#part5-1">The Rob Auton Daily</a></li><li><a href="#part5-2">You Must Remember This</a></li><li><a href="#part5-3">Live From the 405</a></li><li><a href="#part5-4">Have You Heard George’s Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part5-5">Casefile True Crime</a></li><li><a href="#part5-6">This American Life</a></li><li><a href="#part5-7">WTF with Marc Maron</a></li><li><a href="#part5-8">Reply All</a></li><li><a href="#part5-9">The Lazy Genius Podcast</a></li><li><a href="#part5-10">Say Your Mind</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Solo-Podcasting"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Solo-Podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It’s a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you’re about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it’s a great feeling. The idea is simple: You are the protagonist of your own story.</p><h3 id="Go-at-your-own-pace"><a href="#Go-at-your-own-pace" class="headerlink" title="Go at your own pace"></a>Go at your own pace</h3><p>Working on your own gives flexibility with working hours you wouldn’t get as part of a team. That means you can work at your own pace and not feel pressured by a deadline or fear failing since knowing no one but yourself is listening.</p><p>It also means you can work at your own pace as a podcast host without waiting for your audience to be ready.</p><h3 id="Content-is-totally-under-your-control"><a href="#Content-is-totally-under-your-control" class="headerlink" title="Content is totally under your control"></a>Content is totally under your control</h3><p>You’re always controlling your content while working in a solo podcaster scenario. No one else tells you what to say; no one tells you how to say it.</p><p>The upside is that you don’t have to worry about getting your ideas “out there,” which allows you to be creative.No but yourself can dictate the tone of your show.</p><p>Solo podcasters don’t have anyone else to compete with, and they get to choose what they talk about. You’re in full control over everything, which means no advertisers or sponsors are dictating your message.</p><p>That means you can ensure that you deliver a compelling story that people want to hear.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Post-Production-is-Easier"><a href="#Post-Production-is-Easier" class="headerlink" title="Post-Production is Easier"></a>Post-Production is Easier</h3><p>When you work alone, you can take time to make changes or re-edits. Post-production is also easier to deal with if you don’t have the pressure to deliver something at a certain time.</p><h3 id="Connect-with-Your-Audience-on-a-Deeper-Level"><a href="#Connect-with-Your-Audience-on-a-Deeper-Level" class="headerlink" title="Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level"></a>Connect with Your Audience on a Deeper Level</h3><p>Solo podcasting is one of the most efficient ways to build relationships with your audience and connect with them deeper.</p><p>When you’re just starting, your audiences don’t know who you are. So you’ll likely struggle to connect with them on a personal level. But By developing a solo podcast, you allow yourself to develop a personal brand while building a network of people who share your same passion and interests.</p><p>Keep your content focused on your unique story, and be as transparent as possible when you get started. Most listeners prefer to connect with the hosts they find on podcasts than on other media, And Solo Podcast listeners trust their hosts as experts on their topics.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Secondly, before creating an episode, our Listeners may want to hear the story behind the product, so it’s helpful to explain why you built it, what your goals were, what you learned, what you got done, and how the product has evolved.</p><p>It will help you give clear instructions for deciding on solo episode topics that are creative, unique, helpful &amp; engaging to share.</p><h3 id="An-outline-for-an-episode"><a href="#An-outline-for-an-episode" class="headerlink" title="An outline for an episode"></a>An outline for an episode</h3><p>One common mistake when creating a podcast is jumping into it without a plan. Therefore it’s important to have some roadmap for your episode before you even begin working on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast outline"                ></p><p>An outline for a good episode usually includes an introduction&#x2F;promo, the main topic, a break, a conclusion, and a wrap-up. It helps you understand the topic you want to cover.</p><p>If you don’t have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, you will have trouble following along when you sit down to record. Just be careful not to repeat yourself too much. Don’t try and cover every single aspect of your topic.</p><h3 id="A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning"><a href="#A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning" class="headerlink" title="A hook for the episode beginning"></a>A hook for the episode beginning</h3><p>The hook is the first thing that draws the listener in and sets up the rest of the content. What is it about your show that makes people want to listen? Your hook should always be unique, but a little commonality doesn’t hurt.</p><p>If you’re struggling to come up with a hook for an episode of your podcast, here are a few ideas for you to consider:</p><ul><li>What topic do you enjoy talking about?</li><li>What do you want to learn about?</li><li>Is there something, in particular, you’re interested in?</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467"                      border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast"><a href="#Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Mind the length of your solo podcast"></a>Mind the length of your solo podcast</h3><p>Length is everything. Podcasting is about the length of your content, and you will struggle if you have a short episode. You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.</p><p>You’ll lose listeners’ attention if you don’t know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.</p><h3 id="Recap-the-episode"><a href="#Recap-the-episode" class="headerlink" title="Recap the episode"></a>Recap the episode</h3><p>Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast. Doing so allows your listeners to quickly catch up while at the same time giving you a chance to share the most relevant information from the last show.</p><p>That way, when the next podcast episode starts, your listeners will already be up-to-date on essential information.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing"><a href="#The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing" class="headerlink" title="The right tool for recording and editing"></a>The right tool for recording and editing</h3><p>As the popularity of podcasts continues to grow, so does the need for quality, professional sound recordings and editing tools.</p><p>If you’re a podcaster looking to record and edit, Wondershare Filmora must be your priority.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-4.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>For those who would like to produce podcasts or videos on the go, Wondershare Filmora is not only an easy-to-use video editing software but also a good helper for podcast editing.</p><ul><li>Speech-to-text allows smooth conversion of voiceover to text, making your podcasts more accessible.</li><li>Over 2000+ audio resources range from music, audio effects and much more.</li><li>Remove background noise, fade in, fade out, and do lots more audio editing without hassles.</li><li>Supports many shortcut key commands to help tech-savvy and non-tec-savvy individuals to create and edit podcasts quickly.</li><li>Audio Ducking to easily eliminate background noise and unwanted sound recorded while creating podcasts.</li></ul><p>You can export your episodes as MP3 files, which can then be uploaded to any podcast hosting site like iTunes, Podomatic, and Libsyn.

There’s no one to take over if you fall behind schedule or have a day off. Being a solo podcast host takes a lot of time and energy, and you don’t get a choice.</p><p>Even if you manage to pull it off, some people don’t like your podcast and have nothing but negative things to say about you. Preparing for this every time you create a new episode would be best. Therefore You need to have someone to take over when you fall.</p><h3 id="Harder-to-stay-motivated"><a href="#Harder-to-stay-motivated" class="headerlink" title="Harder to stay motivated"></a>Harder to stay motivated</h3><p>The problem with solo podcasts is that there is no built-in motivation. You must do it because you enjoy it or hope it will help someone else. There’s no intrinsic reason to do it. That said, the biggest problem with making solo podcasts is that it becomes harder and harder to stay motivated to keep making episodes.</p><h3 id="Harder-to-deliver-a-Montage"><a href="#Harder-to-deliver-a-Montage" class="headerlink" title="Harder to deliver a Montage"></a>Harder to deliver a Montage</h3><p>If your podcast is mostly monologue or narration, and you don’t do any interviews or interviews with yourself, you will feel like a hamster in a wheel with no release.</p><p>To deliver a montage effectively, you must first create a soundtrack of voiceover audio in your mind. It would be best to hear it repeatedly until you’ve committed the track to memory. Once you have that, you must record the monologue audio and edit it into a montage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-The-Best-10-Solo-Podcasts-Examples"><a href="#Part-5-The-Best-10-Solo-Podcasts-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Makes Adjustments"></a>1. Makes Adjustments</h3><p>Before starting with editing your picture, the first rule is to crop the picture by making appropriate pictures. Make sure that the angle of your photo is correct and straight by removing the unwanted edges and objects from the frame. Your subject should be at the center so that it can instantly catch a viewer’s attention. You can do this entire process manually or automatically on the VSCO Photo Editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vsco-photo-editor-2.jpg"                      alt="vsco crop tool"                ></p><h3 id="2-Control-the-Light-Exposure"><a href="#2-Control-the-Light-Exposure" class="headerlink" title="2.

In the list of awesome top Blu-Ray players, Sony BDP-S3700 has proven its edge with all impressive features. If you are searching for a player that can offer high standard performance even at reasonable price range then S3700 is recommended for you.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It offers excellent picture quality.</li><li>Classic subtle contrast.</li><li>Highly stable and smooth motion.</li><li>Solid upscaler.</li><li>Comes with built in Wi-Fi capability.</li><li>Supports up conversion for 1080p so that it can work upon DVDs.</li><li>3D ready and compatible with 4K Ultra HD content.</li><li>Interactive interface for external world connectivity.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Sound quality is little disappointing.</li><li>Slow load time is a big trouble.</li></ul><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p> When we talk about features then S3700 offers impressive details that can satisfy most of the user needs. At back side of this device you will find an Ethernet port, HDMI output and one coaxial output that assist in making direct connections with external sound systems. At front side of device, you will find a USB port that allows easy connectivity to memory sticks and other similar kind of devices.</p><p> Moving towards the streaming capabilities, you will again find this device useful enough as it allows direct connectivity with Demand 5, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Video and Netflix. If you are a dedicated towards PlayStation video usage then it is possible to get compatible app installed directly on your box.</p><p> One more interesting news is here for you as this device allows users to mirror their smartphone screen to TV directly using Miracast function of player. Thus it becomes much easier to control video as well as music from Android device. Now as this function is not present in other competitors like LG and Panasonic so Sony has an edge over them. If you want to fine tune your image then video noise reduction settings can be applied directly from ‘Mosquito Noise’ feature, it works on edges. Those who want to control noise on broadband range are advised to use ‘Mosaic- like block noise’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/S3700-2.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT6B0DK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01AT6B0DK&linkId=a73a1f695757bdd6c4ea04f82e7f620b" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p> This Sony player is capable enough to perform much better as compared to its price tag. It successfully passed the real words and synthetic image tests on DVD as well as Blu-Ray content. Tests were performed with comparison to high end LG 4K OLED device and the results were quite surprising as this Sony device performed equally good.</p><p> On the other side, if we talk about its playback speed then Sony was not found as fast as its competitors. It took about 24.9 seconds to work with Netflix whereas overall time of 11.26 seconds was taken for starting Mission Impossible III. However, the difference was not much from ratings of LG GP350 but still if you consider speed as your prime concern for performance then it is good to look for Samsun J5900.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/S3700-1.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><h3 id="200610"><a class="link"   href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/200610/3022" >Parental Control Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><span class="text-ad-content">    #1 Rated Parental Control Software.<br/>    Monitor & Control all PC Activity!<br/>        <cite style="color:green">sentrypc.com/parental-controls/</cite>    </span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/200610/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Verdict<p> Sony possesses almost all features of popular Blu-Ray players in year 2016 and with the new release of 2017; Sony has worked well on improvements. Picture quality is not the big issue for selection because almost all players below $500 range offer similar kind of performance but the main consideration for selection should be speed as it is going to cause major change in performance. As S3700 is rated as a solid performer over so many features so it can be preferred for home theatre applications. Its combination of smart functions, decent sound and durable design make it stand out against all competing models in market.</p><p><img                       lazyload

Search for Other Ways"></a>Potion-Powered Pronunciation: Can Voice Changer Apps Be Real Magic? Search for Other Ways</h2><p>The <strong>Magic Call voice changer app</strong> is a mobile app that can make prank calls by changing your voice into male, female, cartoon, and more. In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you’ll have to purchase call credits. Overall, it’s a decent app, although better alternatives exist.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call"><a href="#Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call"></a>Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call</h2><p>To avoid the troubles that come with Magic Call, here are some highly rated alternatives to consider:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App"><a href="#1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can choose from numerous voice actors, including an angry boyfriend, a sexy girl, an old lady, doctors, celebrities, and more.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Learner’s-Handbook-of-AV1-Technology"><a href="#The-Learner’s-Handbook-of-AV1-Technology" class="headerlink" title="The Learner’s Handbook of AV1 Technology"></a>The Learner’s Handbook of AV1 Technology</h2><p>What do Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube have in common? Before you scratch your head to baldness, all these platforms allow you to upload and view videos on-demand. However, the technology that supports this function is much deeper. From the time you shoot your video until you share it with the world, it has undergone several post-production procedures, including compression using the AV1 codec.</p><p>The following is everything you need to know about the AV1 codec. As you keep reading, you will learn about the history of codec AV1, why it is popular, and its application in your video post-production. In addition, you will discover the best video editors to use when working with AV1 format videos. So let your journey to video editing supremacy begin.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Is it popular</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Where is AV1 codec used</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Avidemux</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Lightworks</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Filmora Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Movavi Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">VirtualDub</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec"><a href="#Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is the av01 codec?"></a>Part1: What is the av01 codec?</h2><p>Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec"><a href="#What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec" class="headerlink" title="What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?"></a>What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?</h3><p>A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:</p><ul><li>An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.</li><li>A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.</li></ul><p>In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.</p><h3 id="Is-it-popular"><a href="#Is-it-popular" class="headerlink" title="Is it popular?"></a>Is it popular?</h3><p>Yes, it is. Since its introduction in May 2018, more companies have been integrating the codec in their offerings. Here is a list of companies that offer AV1 codec support:</p><ul><li>Google offers AV1 codec support for Chrome web browser and all Android 10+ smart devices, including your mobile and smart TV. In addition, you can also video chat on Google Duo using the AV1 codec.</li><li>Microsoft also offers AV1 codec support for their Edge browser.</li><li>Other companies that offer codec AV1 support with their software include Opera, Mozilla Firefox, VLC Media Player, and Vivaldi.</li><li>Samsung and LG support 8K streaming on their Q950TS and ZX-OLED TVs, respectively.</li><li>Intel and NVIDIA also offer HD AV1 support with their graphics processing units.</li><li>Additionally, video content providers such as Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube offer AV01 codec support through their devices and online platforms.</li><li>Following successful tests in 2018, Facebook now uses the AV1 codec for videos on the platform.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Where-is-AV1-codec-used"><a href="#Where-is-AV1-codec-used" class="headerlink" title="Where is AV1 codec used?"></a>Where is AV1 codec used?</h3><p>The AV1 codec is offered on a license-free basis to any interested user. Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video"><a href="#Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?"></a>Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?</h2><p>Now that you know what AV1 is, what are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?

But, from a wide plethora of choices available on the internet to download for video editing, you could be confused regarding which one would be the best for you. That is why here in this article, we will talk about <strong>final-cut pro-plug-ins</strong> that can be downloaded from the internet free of cost or by paying.</p><p>If you are not aware of what plug-ins for final cut pro are. Then, let us take a brief look at them: - Third-party add-ons, called plug-ins, are tools used to enhance videos in final cut pro X. They can add new features to your final cut pro software that original developers didn’t include. Most plug-ins are created by ordinary people to enhance their work and are sometimes shared on the internet for free or at a fee.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Fx factory pro</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">mLUT</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Color Finale 2.0</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">NewBlueFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Movie Pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Motion blur plug-in</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Free data pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Distortion effects</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Shutter shock FCPX plug-in</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Part 2.

Fx factory pro</h3><p>Fx factory pro is one of the <strong>best final cut pro plug ins</strong> that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fx-factory-pro.jpg"                      alt="fx factory pro"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with <strong>fcpx plug-ins</strong>, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts.

The format in which a video file is saved often determines its quality and size, but as the file’s size decreases so does its quality.</p><p>That is the reason why Google developed the WebM file format that preserves a video’s quality while minimizing its size. Even though it has been nearly ten years since the WebM file format was first introduced it is still relatively difficult to find a media player that can play this type of video file. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to play WebM video files and introduce you to six free media players you can use to play WebM videos on Mac and PC computers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Play-WebM-Video-Files-on-Windows-and-macOS-without-a-Media-Player"><a href="#How-to-Play-WebM-Video-Files-on-Windows-and-macOS-without-a-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="How to Play WebM Video Files on Windows and macOS without a Media Player?"></a>How to Play WebM Video Files on Windows and macOS without a Media Player?</h2><p>WebM file format is commonly used for videos that are uploaded to the Internet, as they are relatively small in size and capable of delivering excellent image quality. For instance, YouTube videos in resolutions that vary from 360p to 4K are all saved in the WebM file format. In addition, web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge can all play WebM video files without the help of third-party media players.</p><p>In order to play a video saved in the WebM format from the Safari web browser, you must either install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html" >VLC web browser plugin for macOS X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What’s more, you must make sure that the web browser you’re using to open a WebM video is updated, since older versions of Google Chrome, Opera or Mozilla Firefox cannot open the videos saved in this file format.</p><p>Note: If you want to edit the recorded WebM video files, you can check these <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free WebM video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="The-Six-Best-Free-WebM-Media-Players-macOS-and-Windows-10"><a href="#The-Six-Best-Free-WebM-Media-Players-macOS-and-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="The Six Best Free WebM Media Players macOS and Windows 10"></a>The Six Best Free WebM Media Players macOS and Windows 10</h2><p>Besides viewing WebM videos through a web browser you can also use Mac and PC-based media players to watch WebM videos. However, finding a free media player that allows you to open a WebM video doesn’t have to be difficult, despite the fact that this video file format isn’t supported by all media players. So, let’s take a look at the six best WebM media player for macOS and Windows 10.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-VLC"><a href="#1-VLC" class="headerlink" title="1.

The process of opening and playing a video in VLC is the same regardless of the format in which they are saved. After you launch VLC, you just have to select the Open File option from the Media menu and then navigate to the location on your hard drive at which the WebM video you want to play is saved. Click on the file to select it and proceed to click on the Open button. Optionally you can just drag the WebM video from the folder, drop it in VLC and it will start playing automatically.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Windows-Media-Player"><a href="#2-Windows-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, you cannot do so without the necessary audio and video codecs. If you have Windows Media Player 12 you will have to install WebM Media Foundation Components, while for the earlier versions of the software you must install WebM DirectShow filters. All you need to do in order to open a WebM video with Windows Media Player is double-click on it in the Media Library and it will start playing immediately.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-MPlayerX"><a href="#3-MPlayerX" class="headerlink" title="3.
