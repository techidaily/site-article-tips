    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Master-Memes-Access-to-Premium-FREE-Designs"><a href="#Master-Memes-Access-to-Premium-FREE-Designs" class="headerlink" title="Master Memes: Access to Premium FREE Designs"></a>Master Memes: Access to Premium FREE Designs</h2><p>When creating a meme, you will find that it is much easier to start with a pre-designed template. The creators of these temples take into account what is needed to create the perfect meme and even the dimensions needed to upload the meme to various social media sites. This eliminates a lot of work for you, allowing you to create a meme in a few minutes; after all, you can just select a pre-made template and change the images and text to suit your project’s needs.</p><p>In this article, we will be looking at some of the best places to find free meme templates that you can then use to create your memes. All the memes that you can find on all these sites are available to download and edit. If you want to create a meme from scratch, you can download the meme template and use a photo editor to change all aspects of the template.</p><h2 id="Canva-Meme-Theme"><a href="#Canva-Meme-Theme" class="headerlink" title="Canva Meme Theme"></a>Canva Meme Theme</h2><p>Canva is one of the most popular photo editing tools in the market and one of the things that Canva users love about this platform is the availability of templates. There is a meme template on Canva for any type of meme that you would like to create and once you have settled on the meme that you would like to use, you can then use the Canva editor to customize it as desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva-meme-theme.jpg"                      alt="canva meme theme"                ></p><p>Canva makes it very easy to find the template you need as the templates are arranged under various categories. You can also use various filters including filters, style, theme, price, and color to find the perfect template. Most of the themes on Canva are free but there are some advanced templates that you can access on a paid subscription or for a one-time fee.</p><p>The Canva editor has a lot of different features to allow you to edit your selected template in various ways. You can change the color, text font, and images or even re-orient the entire template so you end up with a unique meme to suit your needs.</p><h2 id="Kapwing-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Kapwing-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing Meme Templates"></a>Kapwing Meme Templates</h2><p>Kapwing is another online photo editing tool that also comes with a built-in meme generator. One of the benefits of choosing Kapwing is the numerous templates that you can use to create a unique meme. Each of the templates that you find on Kapwing is completely customizable. You can change the color of the existing images, add your images, change the text font and color and even remove or replace the meme’s background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="kapwing meme templates"                ></p><p>Kapwing also makes it easy for you to find the templates that you need. All available templates on Kapwing are neatly arranged in various categories. The “Trending Now” category allows you to find memes that are relevant to the current market and may get you the best engagement.</p><h2 id="Adobe-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Adobe-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Meme Templates"></a>Adobe Meme Templates</h2><p>If you are looking to create unique and high-quality memes, Adobe Express is one of the best tools to use. This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="adobe meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.</p><p>The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.</p><h2 id="ImgFlip-Meme-Template"><a href="#ImgFlip-Meme-Template" class="headerlink" title="ImgFlip Meme Template"></a>ImgFlip Meme Template</h2><p>If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use. There are thousands of meme templates to choose from, arranged in various genres and themes. Since the templates are added every day, the site has a very convenient search function that you can use to find the most reliable meme for your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imgflip-meme-template.jpg"                      alt="imgflip meme template"                ></p><p>But ImgFlip is not a complete photos editor, meaning that you may not able to change the template too much. The only thing you can do with this tool is to change the caption o the template which can be valuable if you find the right meme template. Once the caption has been added, you can then download the completed meme and then upload it to various social media sites.</p><h2 id="Wepik-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Wepik-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Wepik Meme Templates"></a>Wepik Meme Templates</h2><p>Wepik is another great site if you are looking for different types of memes to use. There are thousands of memes that you can choose from and they are updated every day, giving you a wide variety of choices. The most popular and the newest meme templates are available on the first page, but you can also use the search function to find a particular meme template that may not be on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wepik-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="wepik meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you have selected the meme that you want to use, Wepik shows you details about the template you have chosen. You can then use the Wepik editor to customize the template in various ways. You can use numerous tools to change the color of the meme, edit the text on the meme or even edit the image. Once you are happy with the changes, you can then download the meme to post to your social media pages.</p><h2 id="Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge of Meme Templates"></a>Knowledge of Meme Templates</h2><p><strong>1. Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2. Trending Meme Topics</strong></p><p>You may notice that memes constantly change and a meme that was popular yesterday, may not be very popular today. The following are some of the top trending meme topics recently;</p><ul><li>Prince Louis at the Queen’s Birthday in June</li><li>Megan Thee Stallion and Cara Delevingne in May 2022</li><li>The YouTuber Emma Chamberlain at the Met Gala in May</li><li>Bridgerton Memes in March 2022</li><li>Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker (Kravis) in Vegas</li><li>Euphoria Season 2’s release</li><li>Superbowl Halftime Show Memes</li><li>Zoom Virtual Meeting fails</li><li>Facebook becoming Meta</li><li>Kim Kardashian at the Met Gala</li></ul><p><strong>3.

The VR technology is still in its early stages, and consumers are slowly embracing it.

It is recommended to play it while standing up or sitting on a swivel chair because it requests the player to turn around.</p><p>BAMF VR is one of the best VR games for the Google Cardboard. While it is simple, it has imaginative puzzles. There are no downsides to the game; except players want more levels because it is easy to beat the game.</p><h2 id="4-Sisters"><a href="#4-Sisters" class="headerlink" title="4. Sisters"></a>4. Sisters</h2><p>VR is the best medium for horror games. You just need to seat back and look around as supernatural stuff happen around you.

It is best to prank your friends who think that VR games are not that scary. However, there are reports that it keeps on crashing on low-end Android phones.</p><h2 id="5-Waa-VR"><a href="#5-Waa-VR" class="headerlink" title="5. Waa! VR"></a>5. Waa!

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> Wondershare Filmora</h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes.

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> Wondershare Filmora</h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> Wondershare Filmora</h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/enhance-digital-communication-on-chrome-review-of-the-best-web-based-tts-tools-for-2024/"><u>Enhance Digital Communication on Chrome  Review of the Best Web-Based TTS Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-apps-for-refined-dji-aerial-filmmaking/"><u>2024 Approved  Leading Apps for Refined DJi Aerial Filmmaking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-guide-to-top-free-vectors-graphics-sites-worldwide/"><u>2024 Approved  Guide to Top Free Vectors, Graphics Sites Worldwide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-comprehensible-guide-to-authoritative-testimonial-films/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Comprehensible Guide to Authoritative Testimonial Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-harness-your-windows-10-sound-power/"><u>2024 Approved  Harness Your Windows 10 Sound Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-future-is-now-examining-hp-envy-27s-innovations-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Future Is Now  Examining HP Envy 27'S Innovations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-eliminating-blur-taming-shutter-vibration/"><u>2024 Approved  Eliminating Blur  Taming Shutter Vibration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-capturing-the-skies-in-depth-mavic-pro-discussion-for-2024/"><u>[New] Capturing the Skies - In-Depth Mavic Pro Discussion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-social-media-imitation-how-to-clone-yourself-with-finesse-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Social Media Imitation  How to Clone Yourself with Finesse on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-guide-for-facebook-video-advertising-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Guide for Facebook Video Advertising for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/-new-take-on-favorite-movies-7-alternatives/"><u>[New] A New Take on Favorite Movies - #7 Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-snicker-sphere-hot-gags-and-joke-artists-of-tiktok/"><u>[New] Snicker Sphere  Hot Gags and Joke Artists of TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-elevate-your-channels-optimal-use-of-templated-content-in-yt-descs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Your Channels  Optimal Use of Templated Content in YT Descs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-lava-yuva-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 3 Effective Methods to Fake GPS location on Android For your Lava Yuva 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-comment-finder-you-should-try-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Comment Finder You Should Try for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-safest-15-apps-for-instagram-followings-on-both-systems/"><u>2024 Approved  The Safest 15 Apps for Instagram Followings on Both Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/booktiks-15-newest-must-have-reads-for-you-for-2024/"><u>Booktik's 15 Newest Must-Have Reads for You for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

They’re also easy to mount on almost any surface i-e., mounting onto your bike helmet makes it easy to capture every moment on your ride, so that it doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll be able to capture what’s happening around you.</p><p>GoPro time-lapse is a way to view the world from your camera’s point of view. It allows you to see everything that happened in a short period, either as it happens or over several days. You can use GoPro time-lapse to make videos about your daily life, or even about events like weddings, and vacations. You can use GoPro time-lapse for a more serious purpose.</p><p>There are many different cameras available on the market today that will work with GoPro time-lapse. Time-lapse videos are filmed at a constant speed and then edited together to create a video that shows the passage of time in real-time. In this blog post, we’ll explore why GoPro time-lapse is important, and how it can help you capture your memories.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode"></a>Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode</h2><p>GoPro time-lapse video mode allows you to create a video that shows the passage of time over a period of days or weeks. The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos. They’re great for showing the passage of time, but they can also be used to show the beauty of a place. With GoPro cameras, you can create a time-lapse video in just minutes. Here’s how to shoot your time-lapse video with GoPro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode"><a href="#Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Choose your shooting mode"></a>Step1 Choose your shooting mode</h5><p>Firstly, choose the shooting mode, that is which kind of mode you want.

The interval time is the amount of time between each frame in your video. 30 FPS is used by GoPro time-lapse which means 30 pictures are required for a one-second video. The first step to shooting a GoPro time-lapse video is choosing the interval settings.</p><p>This can be done through GoPro’s settings menu, which can be accessed by tapping the icon in the upper right corner of the main screen, then tapping “Settings” in the menu that appears. the camera will take pictures every few seconds while recording video, which is great if you’re trying to hit a certain number of frames per second (FPS).</p><h5 id="Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button"><a href="#Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button"></a>Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button</h5><p>If you want to shoot time-lapse videos on a GoPro, first you’ll need to mount your camera.

Set up your camera by adjusting the settings for exposure, ISO, and other options in the Settings menu (you can find these settings in the Settings tab)</p><p>You’ll probably want to use a wide-angle lens for this kind of video because you’ll want to capture as much of your surroundings as possible. If you want to change the length of time you want to shoot, press the button again until it says “Time Lapse” or whatever setting you want.</p><h5 id="Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting"><a href="#Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting"></a>Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting</h5><p>When you are done with your shooting press the shutter button to end the shooting.

As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly. In the newer iPhone models like the iPhone 12 series, the software would not automatically save the regular and HDR versions if you set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>How to turn off HDR on your iPhone?</strong></p><p>Step1On your iPhone, open the Settings menu from the list of apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-2.jpg"                      alt="open the settings menu"                ></p><p>Step2Access the Camera tab.</p><p>Step3Under the HDR settings area, slide the toggle for Smart HDR to OFF.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                      alt="slide the toggle for smart hdr to off"                ></p><p>Step4On the regular Camera app, the yellow HDR icon will appear if you switch off Smart HDR.

You can add pre-set effects in the software package or adjust color grading in the videos. The two main color-related adjustments you can make are Color Correction and Color Match to sync the video visuals with zero washed-out look or distortions.</p><p>The only drawback here for editing Dolby Vision HDR footage is that it does not work directly on iPhones. You can make the edits on a Mac computer and then directly export them to iPhones. So, overall, using this software is the best option to try to <strong>convert HDR video to SDR iPhone,</strong> in our experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to edit iPhone HDR video using Filmora?</strong></p><p>Step1Install Filmora and launch the software on your Mac device.</p><p>Step2Click on New Project &gt; Click here to import media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-4.jpg"                      alt="click on new project"                ></p><p>Choose the HDR video from the iPhone device that you transferred to the device in QuickTime Movie format (MOV).</p><p>Step3Drag and drop the video to the timeline section for editing the file.</p><p>Step4Make the necessary edits like Color Matching and Chroma key-based background removal&#x2F;editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-5.jpg"                      alt="make edits"                ></p><p>Step5Click on the Export button on top of the screen.</p><p>Step6Go to the Device tab and choose iPhone.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a or  () format.</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

For this, using high-quality third-party converter solutions is necessary. Choose your option carefully.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Overall, it is possible for the HDR quality videos captured with an iPhone 12 camera to look overexposed&#x2F;washed out. This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro. You can fix the problem by disabling the HDR effect, using a high-quality video editor like Filmora, or changing the color codec.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Solution-2-Get-a-Video-Editing-Software-that-you-can-Edit-Dolby-Vision-Footage-in-Recommended-1"><a href="#Solution-2-Get-a-Video-Editing-Software-that-you-can-Edit-Dolby-Vision-Footage-in-Recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Get a Video-Editing Software that you can Edit Dolby Vision Footage in [Recommended]"></a>Solution 2: Get a Video-Editing Software that you can Edit Dolby Vision Footage in [Recommended]</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best video editing software choices available currently, with a range of high-quality editing functions.

So, overall, using this software is the best option to try to <strong>convert HDR video to SDR iPhone,</strong> in our experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to edit iPhone HDR video using Filmora?</strong></p><p>Step1Install Filmora and launch the software on your Mac device.</p><p>Step2Click on New Project &gt; Click here to import media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-4.jpg"                      alt="click on new project"                ></p><p>Choose the HDR video from the iPhone device that you transferred to the device in QuickTime Movie format (MOV).</p><p>Step3Drag and drop the video to the timeline section for editing the file.</p><p>Step4Make the necessary edits like Color Matching and Chroma key-based background removal&#x2F;editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-5.jpg"                      alt="make edits"                ></p><p>Step5Click on the Export button on top of the screen.</p><p>Step6Go to the Device tab and choose iPhone.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a or  () format.</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

For this, using high-quality third-party converter solutions is necessary. Choose your option carefully.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Overall, it is possible for the HDR quality videos captured with an iPhone 12 camera to look overexposed&#x2F;washed out. This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro. You can fix the problem by disabling the HDR effect, using a high-quality video editor like Filmora, or changing the color codec.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-splashproof-cameras-for-child-filmmakers-in-rainy-days/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Best Splashproof Cameras For Child Filmmakers in Rainy Days</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-the-top-8-collaborative-affordable-android-video-mosaics/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring the Top 8 Collaborative, Affordable Android Video Mosaics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-laughs-in-layout-designer/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Laughs in Layout Designer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-infuse-satire-and-smiles-kapwings-meme-builder-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Infuse Satire & Smiles - Kapwing's Meme Builder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-your-creative-potential-best-free-premiere-pro-libraries/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock Your Creative Potential  Best Free Premiere Pro Libraries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ignite-your-startups-growth-with-these-top-social-media-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Ignite Your Startup's Growth with These Top Social Media Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-uncover-5-powerful-speech-recognition-tools-for-your-mac/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Uncover 5 Powerful Speech Recognition Tools for Your Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-google-play-location-on-infinix-note-30-vip-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Google Play Location On Infinix Note 30 VIP | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-make-animated-videos-for-business-an-ultimate-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated How to Make Animated Videos for Business – an Ultimate Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-igtv-master-video-submission/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock IGTV  Master Video Submission</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-gopro-vs-sony-battle-royale-for-ultimate-action-cameras/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  GoPro Vs.

However, too many 4K cameras make it harder for people to choose the best one based on their needs.</p><hr><p>Looking for video editing software to upgrade your 4K videos? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should be one of the best choices.

It can create footage in DCI and UHD quality and you can capture scenes in MOV, MP4, and AVCHD file formats. The camera has 1”-Type MOS Sensor which creates the background blur that is a trademark of professional film cameras. However, HC-X1 is a camcorder and for those who are used to interchangeable lens cameras, it may not be the right choice. On the other hand, its features guarantee that you will be able to produce footage of the highest standard.</p><hr><h4 id="2-Blackmagic-Design-URSA-Mini-4-6K-Digital-Cinema-Camera"><a href="#2-Blackmagic-Design-URSA-Mini-4-6K-Digital-Cinema-Camera" class="headerlink" title="2.

One of its many advantages over the cameras with similar capabilities is its size. The combinations of size and the EF lens mount that allows you to use a large number of different lenses enables you to shoot a wide range of different cinematic styles with this camera. Super-35mm CMOS Sensor, Compressed Raw Recording, and a maximum video resolution of 4608 x 2592 are just a few reasons why this camera is a great choice, but its downsides include the below-average performance in low light conditions and no ND filters.</p><hr><h4 id="3-Nikon-D500"><a href="#3-Nikon-D500" class="headerlink" title="3.

Camera’s weather-sealed body along with the maximum ISO value at 1640000 speak volumes about what it can do in difficult light and weather conditions. Needless to say, Nikon D500 supports 4K UHD video recording at 30, 25 and 24 FPS frame rates. Perhaps the biggest flaw of this camera is its price because at $1,996.95 it is one of the most expensive APS-C DSLR cameras on the market. On the other hand, it is one of the most feature-packed DSLRs and it is most certainly worth investing in.</p><hr><h4 id="4-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-IV"><a href="#4-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-IV" class="headerlink" title="4.

EOS 5D Mark IV isn’t just an excellent choice for photographers, but for videographers as well. The video options are enhanced by the addition of Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Movie Servo AF that help shooter control focus with ease. The camera can shoot 4K videos at 30FPS and it can capture still frames at an amazing 8.8MP. The biggest downside of this model is that HDMI output is limited to 1080p, which can hardly be counted as a flaw, considering the possibilities this camera provides.</p><hr><h4 id="5-Sony-PXW-Z100-4K-Handheld-XDCAM-Camcorder"><a href="#5-Sony-PXW-Z100-4K-Handheld-XDCAM-Camcorder" class="headerlink" title="5.

It features a 42MP Full-Frame Exmor R BSI CMOS Sensor and BIONZ X™ image processing engine that place it among the best cameras on the market at the moment. It produces 4K video in (3840 x 2160) resolution at up to 30FPS.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Fine-Tuning-Your-Audacity-Recordings"><a href="#Fine-Tuning-Your-Audacity-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="Fine-Tuning Your Audacity Recordings"></a>Fine-Tuning Your Audacity Recordings</h2><p>Most users choose for Voice Memos on Mac or Sound Recorder on PC when they wish to capture audio on their computer. However, despite the fact that these tools let you record audio using the microphone, they lack the features needed for more sophisticated audio recording and editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Audacity-add-audio.jpg"                      alt="record profeesional audio"                ></p><p>Therefore, the majority of users think of Audacity when they wish to record and edit high-quality audio on their PCs. Most people use this open-source audio recorder as their go-to tool because it is totally free to use.</p><p>However, due to its large and difficult to comprehend interface, the majority of users find it difficult to operate. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to quickly record your desktop using Audacity. Even if you’ve never used Audacity before, the procedures we explain here will make it simple for you to record audio of any length.</p><h2 id="1-Download-the-software"><a href="#1-Download-the-software" class="headerlink" title="1. Download the software"></a>1. Download the software</h2><p>Step1Go to your preferred browser and visit the official <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >https://www.audacityteam.org/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using your preferred web browser.</p><p>Step2All the recording devices on your computer will be displayed in a drop-down menu. Choose the microphone you want to employ for the recording. Make sure the microphone is turned on and properly connected to the computer if you can’t see it.</p><p>Step3To choose the kind of track you want, click “Tracks” at the top of the page and then “Add New”. You can just select “Mono” or “Stereo” for the majority of straightforward projects.</p><p>Step4To begin the recording, simply click the “Record” button. As soon as you press record, an audio graph of your voice should start to display. Using the “Shift + R” hotkeys on your keyboard, you can add a new recording if you’d like to.</p><h2 id="2-Recording-using-Mac"><a href="#2-Recording-using-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Recording using Mac"></a>2. Recording using Mac</h2><p>To record audio on your Mac, you might need to install Audacity and additional plugins. The best option is to use the Soundflower program, which enables you to send sound to other apps rather than your computer’s speakers. Here’s how to use Soundflower and Audacity to record audio on a Mac.</p><p>Step1The first step is to install Soundflower and Audacity on your Mac. It costs nothing to download either of these programs.</p><p>Step2The Soundflower app must then be set up. To achieve this, choose “Sounds” from the “System Preferences” menu. By choosing the Output tab, designate “Soundflower” as the sound output device (2ch). After that, launch the Sunflower app, and select the Flower icon in the menu bar to switch the built-in output to “Soundflower 2ch.”</p><p>Step3In the “Device” section of the Audacity preferences box, choose “Soundflower (2ch)”. From the recording area, choose “Software playthrough.” Click “OK” to save the options you’ve selected.</p><p>Step4Launch audacity, then open the app whose audio you wish to record. To begin the recording, click the “Record” button.</p><h2 id="3-Export-your-audio"><a href="#3-Export-your-audio" class="headerlink" title="3. Export your audio"></a>3. Export your audio</h2><p>It’s time to export the finished file after finishing up your Audacity project’s modification. It’s crucial to realize that simply saving your Audacity project doesn’t produce a file that you can share with others.</p><p>You’ll need to do a process known as exporting in order to produce a file that you can distribute and publish to your podcast host, Spotify, or other audio distribution sites. Fortunately, everything is quite easy. Let’s examine Audacity’s exporting procedure.</p><p>Do the following in Audacity to export audio:</p><ol><li>Activate the file menu</li><li>Then click “Export”</li><li>Choose the solution that best suits your needs</li></ol><p>There are already preset options for. MP3,.WAV, and OGG files. If you require any of them, go ahead and choose the appropriate choice.</p><p>You can select from a variety of additional file formats, including FLAC, M4A, WMA, and more, if you select the “Export Audio…” option. But for these, you might need to install FFMPEG as mentioned in this article.</p><p>Simply select the necessary file format from the drop-down box that appears next to “Save as type:” In a moment, we’ll delve deeper into some of the advanced settings.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-specter-3-challenge-golem-4s-arrival/"><u>2024 Approved  Specter 3 Challenge  Golem 4'S Arrival</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-techniques-for-ensuring-unbiased-decision-making/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Techniques For Ensuring Unbiased Decision-Making</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-inflatable-microphones-for-diverse-scenarios/"><u>[Updated] Inflatable Microphones for Diverse Scenarios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-skyrocket-your-periscope-live-transmission-time/"><u>[Updated] Skyrocket Your Periscope Live Transmission Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-creativity-your-steps-toward-a-thriving-design-career-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Creativity  Your Steps Toward a Thriving Design Career for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-making-your-gifs-into-stickers-via-discordwhatsapp/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide  Making Your GIFs Into Stickers via Discord/WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-mastery-of-magnified-mining-maps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastery of Magnified Mining Maps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-ways-to-bypass-activation-lock-on-apple-iphone-11-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-huawei-p60-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass FRP on Huawei P60?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-art-of-eluding-home-school-video-content/"><u>2024 Approved  The Art of Eluding Home School Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-itel-p40plus-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Itel P40+ to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-pioneering-play-integrating-vr-in-recreation/"><u>In 2024, Pioneering Play  Integrating VR in Recreation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/pioneering-color-grading-with-3d-luts-for-2024/"><u>Pioneering Color Grading with 3D LUTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/android-screen-stuck-general-oppo-a59-5g-partly-screen-unresponsive-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Android Screen Stuck General Oppo A59 5G Partly Screen Unresponsive | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/prevent-video-playback-issues-in-android-apps/"><u>Prevent Video Playback Issues in Android Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/elevating-your-role-a-guide-to-exceptional-interviews/"><u>Elevating Your Role  A Guide to Exceptional Interviews</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevate-Your-Images-Learn-Photo-Curvature-in-PS"><a href="#Elevate-Your-Images-Learn-Photo-Curvature-in-PS" class="headerlink" title="Elevate Your Images: Learn Photo Curvature in PS"></a>Elevate Your Images: Learn Photo Curvature in PS</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar.

If information is not delivered in a way that piques the listener’s attention and creates a picture in their mind, the human brain will typically lose interest. The podcast intro lasts for only about sixty seconds.</p><p>They say,</p><p>“The first impression is the last impression.”</p><p>So, how can you utilize these sixty seconds to hook the audience to your podcast? It is through crafting a dramatic intro with a script that it is bound to leave an impression on the listener.</p><p>If you’re new to podcasting or having difficulties attracting an audience, keep reading to get some scoop on how to compose an opening that will sweep the listener off his feet.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcasts-intros"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcasts-intros" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

The introduction to the podcast usually appears at the start of the podcast.</p><p>Its duration varies from thirty to sixty seconds but acts as the determinant of the show’s success. A good podcast intro is like a warrior that aids in scoring the audience, competing with thousands of other openings.</p><p>A well-designed intro usually starts with a hook grabbing the listener’s undivided attention. So the listener would have no choice but to press the play button to find out more. So now, let’s see some key elements of a podcast intro.</p><ul><li><strong>The podcast’s name</strong> is critical to give the listener a sense of what they will be listening to.</li><li><strong>The episode title</strong> is a one-word summation of the entire episode’s content.</li><li><strong>Host introduction</strong>, introduce yourself and the co-hosts to the listener to develop familiarity.</li><li><strong>Background music</strong> draws the listener in and should be relevant to the introduction.</li><li><strong>The tagline</strong> is a major element that retains the listener’s interest.</li><li><strong>Sponsors</strong>, if you have any, put their names in the introduction.</li><li><strong>Disclaimer</strong>, if your podcast contains any spoilers, it should be mentioned in the disclaimer.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what a podcast intro is? Let’s discuss why it matters!</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-intro-to-podcasts-matter"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-intro-to-podcasts-matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?"></a>Part 2. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?</h2><p>Podcasts have gained massive popularity over the last decade. Currently, over 30 million podcasts are available, making it even harder for you to gain an audience if you are starting a new podcast.</p><p>The game is to entice the listener so that he would want more, and for that, we need an intro that is powerful enough to intrigue the audience. After establishing why we need a podcast intro, let’s look at some sample intros from popular podcasts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-do-podcast-intros-in-trending-podcasts-sound-like"><a href="#Part-3-What-do-podcast-intros-in-trending-podcasts-sound-like" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This podcast has around 2.2 million listeners. Ira Glass hosts the show, and episodes are released weekly. Ira introduces a new character in each episode and inquires about their background.</p><h3 id="My-favorite-murder"><a href="#My-favorite-murder" class="headerlink" title="My favorite murder"></a>My favorite murder</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcasts-intros-2.jpg"                      alt="my favorite murder"                ></p><p>My favorite murder is the fifth most popular podcast according to the US charts. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark host this show and discuss the true crime stories narrated by their friends or family. It has also been nominated for the best podcast award and has about 30 million listeners.</p><h3 id="Stuff-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Stuff-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Stuff You Should Know"></a>Stuff You Should Know</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/podcasts-intros-3.jpg"                      alt="stuff you should know"                ></p><p>“Stuff You Should Know” is the sixth most popular podcast, and it is hosted by Josh Clark and Charles W, who usually talk about current customs and traditions. This podcast is very informative and addresses concerns that people face daily. Now let’s analyze the intros of the podcasts as mentioned above.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Elements&#x2F;Podcasts</th><th><em>This American Life</em></th><th><em>My favorite murder</em></th><th><em>Stuff you should know</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sound effects</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Length of the intro</td><td>60 seconds</td><td>50 seconds</td><td>40 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Podcast name</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>Intro of guests</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Disclaimer</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>Genre (of the podcast)</td><td>Storytelling</td><td>Crime show</td><td>Informative</td></tr><tr><td>Podcast intro CTA</td><td>If you haven’t tried the previous episodes, you should, as the story will get deeper and more complicated.</td><td>It is the one where you can email us stories about your childhood pranks or any other incident, and you, too, can be a part of this show.</td><td>We all listen to the stuff you should know podcast to get to the bottom of the biggest mysteries of pop culture.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table 1: shows the analysis of intros of the top 3 podcasts discussed above</em></p><p>Now that we’ve established which elements are more prominent in the intros of some of the most popular podcasts. Let’s review the essentials you should keep in mind when designing your introduction.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-a-good-podcast-intro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?"></a>Part 4. How to make a good podcast intro?</h2><p>If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.</p><h3 id="How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be"><a href="#How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be" class="headerlink" title="How long should a podcast intro be?"></a>How long should a podcast intro be?</h3><p>Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.</p><p>The intro of “This American Life” lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point. However, they did an excellent job of providing just the correct information to pique the audience’s interest.</p><h3 id="Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing"><a href="#Is-background-music-helpful-in-making-the-intro-more-appealing" class="headerlink" title="Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?"></a>Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?</h3><p>Selecting a soundtrack or sound effects for your podcast intro is optional, but it enhances the quality of the content presented. The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.</p><p>A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.</p><h3 id="Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why"><a href="#Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why" class="headerlink" title="Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?"></a>Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?</h3><p>Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account.

How to make a good podcast intro?</h2><p>If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.</p><h3 id="How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be-1"><a href="#How-long-should-a-podcast-intro-be-1" class="headerlink" title="How long should a podcast intro be?"></a>How long should a podcast intro be?</h3><p>Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.</p><p>The intro of “This American Life” lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point.

The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.</p><p>A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.</p><h3 id="Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why-1"><a href="#Should-you-include-a-call-to-action-in-your-intro-and-why-1" class="headerlink" title="Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?"></a>Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?</h3><p>Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account.
