You can control photos as well as videos from a single button on the top - press it one time to capture stills and twice to record videos. One more button is available for Wi-Fi control that also assists in making connection with Cube+ application. You will find a Micro-USB slot and MicroSD card slot behind the door.</p><p> In case of GoPro Hero4 Session, you will not find any LCD screen on this device but you can view scenes on smart phone screen with app connectivity. On the top portion you will find a monochrome LCD panel that assists in easy setting for memory, battery, shooting modes as well as menu. Memory Card slot and USB connector is available besides the door. One LED on front and another on back keeps on indicating recording and wireless activities.</p><h4 id="2-Battery-and-Charging"><a href="#2-Battery-and-Charging" class="headerlink" title="2.Battery and Charging"></a>2.Battery and Charging</h4><p> The Lithium Ion battery of GoPro Hero Session can serve you up to 2 hours with 1080p recording at 30fps frame rate. If you keep your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and capture 8MP photos once&#x2F;second then this battery will work up to 3 hour 35 minutes. For Cube+, the battery will serve you up to 1.5 hours even if you have Wi-Fi in ON position. You can charge its battery via Micro USB port using a simple USB power pack, computer or AC-USB Adapter.</p><h4 id="3-Waterproof"><a href="#3-Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="3.Waterproof"></a>3.Waterproof</h4><p> You can take GoPro Hero Session device under water up to 10 meter or 33 feet even without any additional protective housing.

For taking stills you can easily switch between 3MP, 6Mp and 8MP where automatic exposure effect leads to much impressive results in daylight. But in case of low light performance you may feel little disappointed. The image stabilization feature is a better addition for video modes.</p><p> There is no doubt to say that photo and video mode of Hero Session are impressive with outstanding audio quality. You can switch between various videos modes as: 1440p with 25&#x2F;30 fps, 1080p with 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;48&#x2F;50&#x2F;60fps, 960 with 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 fps and 720p at 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 and 100fps.

The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

Choose your option carefully.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Overall, it is possible for the HDR quality videos captured with an iPhone 12 camera to look overexposed&#x2F;washed out. This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro. You can fix the problem by disabling the HDR effect, using a high-quality video editor like Filmora, or changing the color codec.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-the-spectrums-impact-applying-color-dynamics-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Spectrum's Impact  Applying Color Dynamics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/jumpstart-your-virtual-engagement-with-these-tips-for-livestreams-for-2024/"><u>Jumpstart Your Virtual Engagement with These Tips for Livestreams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-inspirational-quotations-for-the-metaverse-era/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Inspirational Quotations for the Metaverse Era</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-peek-into-the-viral-world-of-stock-photo-memes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Peek Into the Viral World of Stock Photo Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-pro-learning-snapseed-essentials-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Novice to Pro  Learning Snapseed Essentials for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-funnyframefinder-your-source-for-meme-creation-online-for-2024/"><u>[New] FunnyFrameFinder  Your Source for Meme Creation Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-blueprint-for-a-thriving-portfolio-in-graphics/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Blueprint for a Thriving Portfolio in Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-6-high-definition-21-hdmi-models-analyzed/"><u>2024 Approved  6 High-Definition 2.1 HDMI Models Analyzed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/filmmakers-dilemma-picking-between-filmora-and-democracy-creator-for-2024/"><u>Filmmaker's Dilemma  Picking Between Filmora & Democracy Creator for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/9-best-phone-monitoring-apps-for-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>9 Best Phone Monitoring Apps for Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-6-plus-in-different-conditionsin-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock Stolen iPhone 6 Plus In Different Conditionsin | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-illuminate-your-recording-setup-how-to-prevent-a-dark-screen-on-obs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Illuminate Your Recording Setup  How to Prevent a Dark Screen on OBS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cracking-the-code-of-viral-success-with-tiktoks-top-strategies/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cracking the Code of Viral Success with TikTok's Top Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-starting-from-scratch-stardews-ginger-island-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Starting From Scratch  Stardew's Ginger Island Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-kids-guide-to-video-editing-10-essential-apps-to-learn-and-play/"><u>New In 2024, Kids Guide to Video Editing 10 Essential Apps to Learn and Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/elevate-your-gameplay-with-the-12-unmatched-tycoon-experiences/"><u>Elevate Your Gameplay with the #12 Unmatched Tycoon Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-samsung-galaxy-f34-5g-pattern-lock-screen-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Samsung Galaxy F34 5G Pattern Lock Screen Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Starting from opening titles and ending credits to transition slides and text snippets, texts and titles always enhance video content. It is quite obvious that animated texts draw more attention than showing static text effects. If you are new to video editing and text animation, you should be aware of the common types of text animation.</p><p>You should use these common text animations in your videos because the viewers are already comfortable watching them. Apart from using them directly, you should use them to create some interesting and stunning text animations so that the video looks different from others. We have listed down the common as well as interesting text animation examples for you.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Parallax scrolling</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Fade in and fade out</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Sliding text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Text breaks away animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Typing text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Morphing Text Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Combined Slide Out Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The Stomp Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">The Curtain Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Animated Text Outline Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-6">Animated Text Fill Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-7">Neon Light Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-8">In and Out of Focus Text Effect</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Make a Text Animation Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation" class="headerlink" title="4. Text breaks away animation"></a>4. Text breaks away animation</h3><p>There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations. That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.</p><h3 id="5-Typing-text-animation"><a href="#5-Typing-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="5. Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text" class="headerlink" title="6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text"></a>6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</h3><p>Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies. This is even used in modern short videos to show credits as well as information as per requirements. Along with vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling text is quite common these days to show a few lines of text instead of showing them together in a paragraph.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples"><a href="#Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples"></a>Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</h2><p>You should always keep the basic and the common types of text animations in mind and come up with interesting and creative text animations. We are listing down some popular text animation examples that you can use on your video.</p><h3 id="1-Morphing-Text-Animation"><a href="#1-Morphing-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1. Morphing Text Animation"></a>1. Morphing Text Animation</h3><p>When there are multiple words to display one by one, instead of fade in and fade out effect, you can opt for morphing text animation. In this animation, the words seem to get morphed into one another. So, the first word will morph into the second word for the second word to appear on the screen and the sequence continues. The animation can be done fast to showcase multiple words in a short time period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/morphing-text-animation.jpg"                      alt="morphing text animation"                ></p><h3 id="2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation"><a href="#2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation" class="headerlink" title="2. Combined Slide Out Animation"></a>2. Combined Slide Out Animation</h3><p>Generally, in a slide out text animation, the text comes out of a border and the animation type remains the same throughout. However, in the modified slide out animation, the text comes out of the border but it can come out of the top, the side, as well as both sides of the border. The border can also animate to move from the side to the top as well as be placed obliquely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/combined-slide-out-animation.jpg"                      alt="combined slide out animation"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-Stomp-Animation"><a href="#3-The-Stomp-Animation" class="headerlink" title="3. The Stomp Animation"></a>3. The Stomp Animation</h3><p>The stomp effect is quite eye-catching due to its dynamic nature. In this animation, the words come out from another word till the entire sentence is displayed. For example, you have a sentence of four words to display. So, you should show the first word and the second word will come out of the first word and the sequence will continue. If you have two words, you can show them coming out of one another from the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-stomp-animation.jpg"                      alt="the stomp animation"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Curtain-Animation"><a href="#4-The-Curtain-Animation" class="headerlink" title="4. The Curtain Animation"></a>4. The Curtain Animation</h3><p>In this animation, the moving boxes will slide in and slide out and in the process, they will reveal the text hidden behind them. It looks similar to parting the curtain and getting a view. Thereafter, the boxes will slide back in and cover up the text. The sequence will continue to reveal new texts as required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-curtain-animation.jpg"                      alt="the curtain animation"                ></p><h3 id="5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect"><a href="#5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Animated Text Outline Effect"></a>5. Animated Text Outline Effect</h3><p>This is one of the stunning After Effects text animation examples whereby the outline of the text is made to animate with different colors so that the text becomes eye-catching. The text fill color should stay the same as the background so that only the outline is visible and the outline will be moving around one another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-outline-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated outline effect"                ></p><h3 id="6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect"><a href="#6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Animated Text Fill Effect"></a>6. Animated Text Fill Effect</h3><p>This is one of the most popular GSAP text animation examples whereby you display a sentence with bold style and a color should be moving across the characters in the text. The animated text fill will stay within the characters and should not spill out in the background. The background should be dark for better focus and attention grabbing. Sometimes, people make the color roll from left to right or the text can have a gradient color with the color waving up and down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-text-fill-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated text fill effect"                ></p><h3 id="7-Neon-Light-Animation"><a href="#7-Neon-Light-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7. Neon Light Animation"></a>7. Neon Light Animation</h3><p>There are different variations of neon light animation that cool super cool. You can go for the simple neon light animation where the text says still and the neon lights fade in and out. You can change the color of the lights if you plan to keep the text for some time. If you are using a large text, you can go for the modified neon light animation where you can shine in and out for individual characters and the lights could be flickering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/neon-light-animation.jpg"                      alt="neon light animation"                ></p><h3 id="8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect"><a href="#8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect"></a>8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect</h3><p>Instead of bringing the entire sentence into focus, you can use a square box to run over the sentence and bring the focus on the words depending on the position of the square box. The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/in-and-out-focus-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="in and out focus text effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling-1"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out-1"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation-1"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation-1"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Text breaks away animation"></a>4. Text breaks away animation</h3><p>There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations. That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.</p><h3 id="5-Typing-text-animation-1"><a href="#5-Typing-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text"></a>6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</h3><p>Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies. This is even used in modern short videos to show credits as well as information as per requirements. Along with vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling text is quite common these days to show a few lines of text instead of showing them together in a paragraph.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples"></a>Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</h2><p>You should always keep the basic and the common types of text animations in mind and come up with interesting and creative text animations. We are listing down some popular text animation examples that you can use on your video.</p><h3 id="1-Morphing-Text-Animation-1"><a href="#1-Morphing-Text-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Morphing Text Animation"></a>1. Morphing Text Animation</h3><p>When there are multiple words to display one by one, instead of fade in and fade out effect, you can opt for morphing text animation. In this animation, the words seem to get morphed into one another. So, the first word will morph into the second word for the second word to appear on the screen and the sequence continues. The animation can be done fast to showcase multiple words in a short time period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/morphing-text-animation.jpg"                      alt="morphing text animation"                ></p><h3 id="2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation-1"><a href="#2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Combined Slide Out Animation"></a>2. Combined Slide Out Animation</h3><p>Generally, in a slide out text animation, the text comes out of a border and the animation type remains the same throughout. However, in the modified slide out animation, the text comes out of the border but it can come out of the top, the side, as well as both sides of the border. The border can also animate to move from the side to the top as well as be placed obliquely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/combined-slide-out-animation.jpg"                      alt="combined slide out animation"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-Stomp-Animation-1"><a href="#3-The-Stomp-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Stomp Animation"></a>3. The Stomp Animation</h3><p>The stomp effect is quite eye-catching due to its dynamic nature. In this animation, the words come out from another word till the entire sentence is displayed. For example, you have a sentence of four words to display. So, you should show the first word and the second word will come out of the first word and the sequence will continue. If you have two words, you can show them coming out of one another from the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-stomp-animation.jpg"                      alt="the stomp animation"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Curtain-Animation-1"><a href="#4-The-Curtain-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="4. The Curtain Animation"></a>4. The Curtain Animation</h3><p>In this animation, the moving boxes will slide in and slide out and in the process, they will reveal the text hidden behind them. It looks similar to parting the curtain and getting a view. Thereafter, the boxes will slide back in and cover up the text. The sequence will continue to reveal new texts as required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-curtain-animation.jpg"                      alt="the curtain animation"                ></p><h3 id="5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect-1"><a href="#5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Animated Text Outline Effect"></a>5. Animated Text Outline Effect</h3><p>This is one of the stunning After Effects text animation examples whereby the outline of the text is made to animate with different colors so that the text becomes eye-catching. The text fill color should stay the same as the background so that only the outline is visible and the outline will be moving around one another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-outline-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated outline effect"                ></p><h3 id="6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect-1"><a href="#6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Animated Text Fill Effect"></a>6. Animated Text Fill Effect</h3><p>This is one of the most popular GSAP text animation examples whereby you display a sentence with bold style and a color should be moving across the characters in the text. The animated text fill will stay within the characters and should not spill out in the background. The background should be dark for better focus and attention grabbing. Sometimes, people make the color roll from left to right or the text can have a gradient color with the color waving up and down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-text-fill-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated text fill effect"                ></p><h3 id="7-Neon-Light-Animation-1"><a href="#7-Neon-Light-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Neon Light Animation"></a>7. Neon Light Animation</h3><p>There are different variations of neon light animation that cool super cool. You can go for the simple neon light animation where the text says still and the neon lights fade in and out. You can change the color of the lights if you plan to keep the text for some time. If you are using a large text, you can go for the modified neon light animation where you can shine in and out for individual characters and the lights could be flickering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/neon-light-animation.jpg"                      alt="neon light animation"                ></p><h3 id="8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect"></a>8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect</h3><p>Instead of bringing the entire sentence into focus, you can use a square box to run over the sentence and bring the focus on the words depending on the position of the square box. The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/in-and-out-focus-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="in and out focus text effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Ableton Live is one of the greatest DAWs to learn if you’re just beginning to make beats or write songs. For many artists, Ableton Live has emerged as the preferred setting for writing music with an eye on live performance. If you’re coming from a conventionally built digital audio workstation, Live’s approach to composition and arrangement is undoubtedly odd.</p><p>One of the most user-friendly pieces of music software ever created is Ableton Live. With a little instruction, you can quickly master Ableton fade and produce recordings of studio-caliber. Since then, Ableton has emerged as one of the top names in electronic music production. Live is a robust DAW with mature capabilities that can be used to produce any kind of music, although it works especially well with certain processes. Follow this guide to learn about Ableton fade in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton"><a href="#Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton"></a>Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton</h2><p>You’ve certainly heard the terms “audio fade-in” and “audio fade-out” a few times as a newbie, and you may be wondering what they mean and how you might apply them to your films. Crossfading clips on the same track is easier and only needs one track, however crossfading clips on different tracks allows you to apply independent audio effects processing and gives greater flexibility in structuring the fade curves. Both strategies may be helpful for organizing and creating sounds.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades"></a>Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades</h3><p>To avoid any clicks, turn on Create Fades on Clip Edges in the Record&#x2F;Warp&#x2F;Launch section of Live’s Preferences. The beginning and ending of the Clip will each have a little fade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-fades-warp-fades.jpg"                      alt="create fades warp fades"                ></p><p>You must disable the automated mode in order to alter the clip fades. You may accomplish this by doing the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/disable-automated-mode-ableton.jpg"                      alt="disable automated mode ableton"                ></p><p>The fade-in and fade-out handles should display when you hover the mouse icon over the audio clip you want to fade. In case, if they don’t, hit ‘A’ on your keyboard to make them appear. Then, you hold down the mouse button while left-clicking on the handle you wish to fade and lowering the fader.</p><h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.

It will load the Utility effect to the specified MIDI track wherever you drag it on the track. Left-click on the little box in the bottom right corner of the DAW to view the Utility effect on your track. Follow the procedure below to do so.<br>Live’s ability to easily clean up the beginning and conclusion of audio samples has long been one of its strengths.

There are two handles you may drag on the left and right, as well as two curve adjusters:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/midi-track-ableton.jpg"                      alt="midi track ableton"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles"></a>Part 2. Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles</h2><p><strong>Utilize Keywords:</strong> Make sure your video title includes important SEO ranking variables since keywords YouTube video results mainly depend on SEO. The SEO keywords you want to rank for should be included in the perfect video names. To find relevant, easily ranked keywords, use a keyword research tool. Additionally, it is best to use competitive but highly searched keywords. Since YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine’s ranking formulas are largely the same.</p><p><strong>Video Title Length:</strong> Less than 70 characters make up the best YouTube video titles. Unless you have enough room, avoid including extraneous information in the title, such as the episode number or channel name. Despite YouTube’s 100-character maximum for video names, most search engines, including Google, will truncate your title after 70 characters.</p><p><strong>Use Truncation:</strong> Therefore, after you’ve used up your first 50 characters that are the most crucial, focus on your second part’s SEO-friendly components. The second section of your title will still aid in discoverability even if it is abbreviated since Google is likely to utilize the whole thing for ranking. Use the aforementioned YouTube title generating tool if you are running out of ideas.</p><p><strong>Improve Your Click Thru Rate (CTR):</strong> If someone sees your video in the YouTube or Google search results, they may either click on it or they can opt to skip over it and click on another video. They will typically base their choice on the appeal of your video title, the beauty of your selected thumbnail, and the applicability of your video description. When someone clicks on your video, it tells Google and YouTube that it’s a video that people are interested in watching.</p><p><strong>To increase the impact of your title, use emotive language:</strong> It’s crucial to take into account the emotions that viewers could experience while producing content for YouTube. Think about using some important emotion terms in your title if you want it to elicit a feeling. This may increase the impact of your title and draw in readers who are seeking for a certain emotion. You may give viewers an experience that is more powerful and memorable by considering the emotions that your material can elicit in them.</p><p><strong>Include Numbers When Needed:</strong> The likelihood that someone will interact with material given in a numerical format is higher. Therefore, it’s crucial to incorporate numbers in your titles if you want people to click on them. It may be useful to include numbers in headlines when it makes sense to do so. This is based on a time-tested marketing principle that still holds true today.</p><p><strong>Add Relevant Words:</strong> Your video’s title should briefly describe its subject matter. When people click on videos that don’t live up to their expectations, they feel irate and irritated. They make a mental note to stop watching more of your films as they swiftly leave to find a more suitable video. As soon as Google and YouTube become aware of this conduct, your videos start to fall in the ranks.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is crucial to invest work into producing attention-grabbing titles for your YouTube videos if you want to make sure they are competitive and visible to a wide audience.

Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles"></a>Part 2. Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles</h2><p><strong>Utilize Keywords:</strong> Make sure your video title includes important SEO ranking variables since keywords YouTube video results mainly depend on SEO. The SEO keywords you want to rank for should be included in the perfect video names. To find relevant, easily ranked keywords, use a keyword research tool. Additionally, it is best to use competitive but highly searched keywords. Since YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine’s ranking formulas are largely the same.</p><p><strong>Video Title Length:</strong> Less than 70 characters make up the best YouTube video titles. Unless you have enough room, avoid including extraneous information in the title, such as the episode number or channel name. Despite YouTube’s 100-character maximum for video names, most search engines, including Google, will truncate your title after 70 characters.</p><p><strong>Use Truncation:</strong> Therefore, after you’ve used up your first 50 characters that are the most crucial, focus on your second part’s SEO-friendly components. The second section of your title will still aid in discoverability even if it is abbreviated since Google is likely to utilize the whole thing for ranking. Use the aforementioned YouTube title generating tool if you are running out of ideas.</p><p><strong>Improve Your Click Thru Rate (CTR):</strong> If someone sees your video in the YouTube or Google search results, they may either click on it or they can opt to skip over it and click on another video. They will typically base their choice on the appeal of your video title, the beauty of your selected thumbnail, and the applicability of your video description. When someone clicks on your video, it tells Google and YouTube that it’s a video that people are interested in watching.</p><p><strong>To increase the impact of your title, use emotive language:</strong> It’s crucial to take into account the emotions that viewers could experience while producing content for YouTube. Think about using some important emotion terms in your title if you want it to elicit a feeling. This may increase the impact of your title and draw in readers who are seeking for a certain emotion. You may give viewers an experience that is more powerful and memorable by considering the emotions that your material can elicit in them.</p><p><strong>Include Numbers When Needed:</strong> The likelihood that someone will interact with material given in a numerical format is higher. Therefore, it’s crucial to incorporate numbers in your titles if you want people to click on them. It may be useful to include numbers in headlines when it makes sense to do so. This is based on a time-tested marketing principle that still holds true today.</p><p><strong>Add Relevant Words:</strong> Your video’s title should briefly describe its subject matter. When people click on videos that don’t live up to their expectations, they feel irate and irritated. They make a mental note to stop watching more of your films as they swiftly leave to find a more suitable video. As soon as Google and YouTube become aware of this conduct, your videos start to fall in the ranks.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is crucial to invest work into producing attention-grabbing titles for your YouTube videos if you want to make sure they are competitive and visible to a wide audience.

Though it may be a low-grade virtual reality, the thing is, it’s still VR. Google has a platform wherein you can open your android phone into a cut-rate VR viewer called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Google Cardboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The focus of this app is mostly put on games and experiences but it also empowers VR videos which are lightly immersed.</p><p>When your android phone has a VR viewer, you can have your own freedom of watching and looking around the world for 360-degree videos. Whether you’re watching an animated trippy clip, savoring a concert footage, watching stunts from all sides and angles; with VR viewer, it would feel like you’re actually among the crowd or in the place as the ones you’re watching. VR viewers like Google Cardboard makes the experience of watching videos less passive and creates new ways of visual storytelling.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">2.Steps to Watch 360 Videos on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part3">3.Watching Local Videos on Android</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Choosing-between-VR-and-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos"></a>Part 1. Choosing between VR and 360 Videos</h2><p>The first distinction between VR and 360 Videos is that 360 videos can be watched and viewed with Cardboard and other VR handsets but 360 videos aren’t just like VR videos because VR videos with the right content has the depth of illusion.</p><p><strong>VR videos</strong> are stereoscopic 3D (has a different right and left eye point of view) which means these VR videos are providing added immersion by giving the sense of being on place in the world you’re watching such as nearby close-up objects while further items seem to off and far away. This only sounds like a very subtle difference between a 360 video and a VR video but in addition, the 3D quality is better used on VR handsets and can be justified by just placing your android phone up your eyes.</p><p>However, <strong>360 videos</strong> act mostly in the same manner. With the use of a phone’s gyroscope, it will let you look around as you take footage and they can still be viewed via VR viewer in good quality. Most cases show that non-VR video contents seem to be actually sharper when viewed on Cardboard. That’s why sometimes, depth is swapped with clarity whenever you choose between VR and 360 videos.</p><p>The higher frame rate and resolution of 360 videos and VR videos result to more pleasurable video experience especially via Cardboard. Videos with lower frame rate can actually add blurry artifacts which can then cause you to be a bit nauseous while watching the video. Nasty blurs can affect the focus of your eye that’s why you may feel nauseous. Opt for VR and 360 videos that have options of maximum quality when streaming. It’s okay if it needs more bandwidth. Just try finding the best versions and quality local videos whenever possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-Watch-360-Videos-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-Watch-360-Videos-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The tips given here will be very simple and implementable. Moreover, these helpful tips can turn you into the best unboxing influencer in a limited time. So, let’s get into them without any further delay:</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Keep-Your-Videos-Short"><a href="#Tip-1-Keep-Your-Videos-Short" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Keep Your Videos Short"></a>Tip 1: Keep Your Videos Short</h3><p>Primarily, look at the basic factor of TikTok that actually attract a viewer. The first thing you should keep in mind while creating an unboxing video is to make it short. People who want to watch long videos can do that on YouTube, but the TikTok audience loves short videos. As you already know, TikTok allows you to create videos of 15 seconds, 60 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes.</p><p>However, the optimal recommended length for good and engaging TikTok’s 21 to 34 seconds. TikTok comprises hyper-specific algorithms which could detect if the viewer watched your video to the end or just passed it up. Thus, ensure you don’t make long <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> videos, which will bore the viewers.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-the-Right-Hashtag-to-Reach-Your-Audience"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-the-Right-Hashtag-to-Reach-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience"></a>Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience</h3><p>One of the most common and effective ways to increase followers on any platform is to use the hashtag. No matter if you are working on <strong>kawaii unboxing TikTok</strong> or a technical one, always use the right hashtag. It is like you are taking part in the conversation on social media.</p><p>Furthermore, hashtags lead to high user engagement and promote your brand. Therefore, if you have no idea about picking hashtags related to your product, the table mentioned below will help you:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hashtag</strong></th><th><strong>Total Views</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>#Unboxing</strong></td><td>2.9B</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingasmr</strong></td><td>585.8M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingtoys</strong></td><td>427.6M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingvideo</strong></td><td>362.8M</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Tip-3-Make-Your-Videos-Compatible-with-Small-Screen"><a href="#Tip-3-Make-Your-Videos-Compatible-with-Small-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen"></a>Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen</h3><p>No one watches TikTok on big screens. Before uploading a video, ensure it is compatible with a small screen. You can also shoot your video in both portrait and landscape mode, but 90% of people prefer to watch in portrait mode. Also, cross-check the <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> resolution before posting it and make sure it’s 1080 x1920.</p><p>However, if the video’s resolution exceeds 1080p, don’t panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it’s 72MB, and for Apple, it’s 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="create proper size tiktok videos"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition"><a href="#Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition"></a>Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition</h3><p>It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it. Before shooting a video, ensure the environment is neat, clean, and tidy. Moreover, focus on the lighting of a room and try to use aesthetic lights that can cast delightful impressions on users. Play nice background music that can cast soothing effects on the users.</p><p>Create a theme color for your page to give a personalized look to your TikTok. These are very minute details that are mostly eliminated, but they have a part in the growth of your <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="have a proper recording environment"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Be-Honest-and-Personable"><a href="#Tip-5-Be-Honest-and-Personable" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable"></a>Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable</h3><p>Now, many content creators boost a product that is actually not that good. Before selecting a product for an <strong>unboxing video TikTok</strong>, confirm whether it is worth it or not. Never give false information about the product because it will cause a negative impression on viewers. Always explain the item’s specs and price and guide the viewer if that is budget-friendly.</p><p>Above all, categorize the products in variable names like bags, shoes, and clothes so viewers can watch videos without hassle. If you are working on makeup and skincare products, mention their expiry dates, size, and other factors.</p><h3 id="Tip-6-Ask-People-to-Follow-Like-Comment-and-Share"><a href="#Tip-6-Ask-People-to-Follow-Like-Comment-and-Share" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Ask People to Follow, Like, Comment and Share"></a>Tip 6: Ask People to Follow, Like, Comment and Share</h3><p>Communication is the key to better understanding and higher productivity. Conversing with the audience and then asking them to follow your page is not as bad as many think.

Before uploading a video, ensure it is compatible with a small screen. You can also shoot your video in both portrait and landscape mode, but 90% of people prefer to watch in portrait mode. Also, cross-check the <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> resolution before posting it and make sure it’s 1080 x1920.</p><p>However, if the video’s resolution exceeds 1080p, don’t panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it’s 72MB, and for Apple, it’s 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="create proper size tiktok videos"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition"></a>Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition</h3><p>It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it. Before shooting a video, ensure the environment is neat, clean, and tidy. Moreover, focus on the lighting of a room and try to use aesthetic lights that can cast delightful impressions on users. Play nice background music that can cast soothing effects on the users.</p><p>Create a theme color for your page to give a personalized look to your TikTok.

Before selecting a product for an <strong>unboxing video TikTok</strong>, confirm whether it is worth it or not. Never give false information about the product because it will cause a negative impression on viewers. Always explain the item’s specs and price and guide the viewer if that is budget-friendly.</p><p>Above all, categorize the products in variable names like bags, shoes, and clothes so viewers can watch videos without hassle.

The equipment and setup"></a>1. The equipment and setup</h3><p> To shoot quality 360 degrees panoramas with fisheye, it is imperative to get the equipment as well as the set up right. Your equipment needs to be calibrated properly to make the stitching process nice and easy. To find the best setting for your equipment, the grid method is recommended on the panohead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panohead-for-fishlens.jpg"                      alt="Panohead for Fisheye lens"                ></p><h3 id="2-Leveling-and-rotating"><a href="#2-Leveling-and-rotating" class="headerlink" title="2. Leveling and rotating"></a>2. Leveling and rotating</h3><p> Other than setting up and calibrating the equipment in the right manner, it is important to keep the camera steady and leveled as you make the rotations to take shots. For leveling, it is recommended to use an appropriate leveling base, while for rotation, using a panning clamp on top of the ballhead is highly recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panning-clam-on-ballhead.jpg"                      alt="Panning clam on ballhead"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-actual-shooting"><a href="#3-The-actual-shooting" class="headerlink" title="3. The actual shooting"></a>3. The actual shooting</h3><p> For a full frame camera with 15mm fisheye lens in the portrait position, you will require a total of six shot rounds and 1 up to complete a full sphere. If you were using a crop-sensor camera, you will need to have a 10mm fisheye lens to achieve the same sequence.</p><p> But if you don’t mind the resolution, you are free to use 12mm fisheye on full frame or 8mm fisheye on a crop sensor for four shots round with the camera at five degrees up. With this method, there will be no need for a zenith shot and you can easily patch the tripod spot when editing in Photoshop.</p><p> This video will show you simple steps on shooting 360 degree images with fisheye lens</p><p> <strong>Keep this in mind when shooting 360 degree panoramas with fisheye</strong></p><p> In normal photography, it always pays to remember what to include and what to exclude in your shots. When it comes to shooting 360s, it becomes more complicated since everything is included. For you to take successful 360s with fisheye therefore, you need to consider keenly where you stand. The fisheye lens will introduce a lot of space between you and the subject, hence you must consider how close or far away you are from the subject so that the pieces of the compositional puzzle will fall in place smoothly both in the horizontal and vertical planes.</p><h2 id="Stitching-360-degrees-panoramas-after-shooting"><a href="#Stitching-360-degrees-panoramas-after-shooting" class="headerlink" title="Stitching 360 degrees panoramas after shooting"></a>Stitching 360 degrees panoramas after shooting</h2><p> To stitch 360s taken by fisheye lenses after shooting, you will need panorama software like <a class="link"   href="http://www.kolor.com/" >Autopano Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.ptgui.com/" >PTGui <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. For Autopano Pro, you begin by importing the images into the software and ensuring that the EXIF are displayed correctly on the program. With the right settings in place, the next step is to launch the direct stitching feature if you don’t want to go the manual way. Once the stitching is done, it will be important to present the output online. This can be done using <a class="link"   href="http://www.ggnome.com/pano2vr" >Pano2VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or you could simply upload the finished panoramas to <a class="link"   href="https://www.360cities.net/" >360cities <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for online viewing.</p><p> You might be also interested in:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to stitch GoPro clips into 360 videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What’s-fisheye-lenses"><a href="#What’s-fisheye-lenses" class="headerlink" title="What’s fisheye lenses"></a>What’s fisheye lenses</h2><p> Fisheye lens refers to an ultra wide angle lens used to produce strong visual distortions with the aim of creating a wide hemispherical or panoramic image. Fisheye lenses are able to achieve very wide angles of view not through the production of straight lines of perspectives, but through a special mapping which makes the resulting images have the characteristic convex non-rectilinear appearance.</p><p> The term fisheye was started by American Physicist and inventor Robert Wood in 1906 and it was in reference to how a fish would have an ultra wide hemispherical view while swimming deep in the waters. The first practical use of these kinds of lenses was in 1920s in meteorology when they were used to study the formation of clouds up in the sky. The angles for these lenses are always very wide and can range from anywhere between 1000 and 1800, while their focal lengths depend on the format of the film as well as the intended applications.</p><p> The fisheye lenses are used for a myriad of applications, especially in digital photography. They can also be used for re-projecting images captured by a fisheye lens or computer generated graphics onto hemispherical screens. Additionally, the lenses can be used in scientific photography such as studying canopy geometry, recording meteors and aurora, calculating near-ground solar radiation as well as in peepholes to offer a wide field of view to the users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fisheye-lens-image.jpg"                      alt="create 360 photos with fisheye lens"                ></p><p> Conclusion</p><p> Fisheye lenses have been around for a while now and the process of creating 360 panoramas with them may not be very challenging, but great results are achieved through practice and proper stitching. Once the photos are taken, you can use premium panorama software like Autopano Pro or you can use free options like the Microsoft ICE or Hugin. Ones stitching are done, it is imperative to have the final works uploaded online for others to view.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dissecting-video-production-mastery-with-xmedia-studio-suite/"><u>2024 Approved  Dissecting Video Production Mastery with XMedia Studio Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-ways-to-convey-your-story-through-videos/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Ways to Convey Your Story Through Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-visual-delight-expertly-ranked-top-8k-televisions-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Visual Delight  Expertly Ranked Top 8K Televisions Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-spectacular-screen-showdown-sj6-vs-the-4k-innovators-of-xiaomi-for-2024/"><u>[New] Spectacular Screen Showdown  SJ6 Vs.
