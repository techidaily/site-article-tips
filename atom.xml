Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

There are different video shooting modes available. You can choose from super slow-motion, timelapse, and even hyper-lapse. Timelapse is capturing a fixed frame multiple times at regular intervals. Thereafter, the captured frames are compiled in a short video form. The frame rate is set low and the phone camera stays fixed at its position.</p><p>On the other hand, a hyper-lapse is a timelapse where the camera moves. You must have come across videos where timelapse plays for a few seconds. You must have noticed how the timelapse transforms the entire video content immensely. You can accomplish the same with your Samsung time lapse and hyper-lapse feature. We will illustrate how to create timelapse video on Samsung mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung</h2><p>Suppose you want to shoot a video of the sunrise or sunset. If you shoot in the regular video mode, the video length will be long. When you play the video, the changes in the movement of the sun will be super slow. That is where timelapse can do wonders.

The overall dimension of this drone unit is 20x20x6.5 whereas maximum weight goes up to 450 grams thus it cannot be called as a tiny drone. When weighted with camera and prop guards, then this unit has overall weight of 600 grams. This dimension and weight makes this drone much stable in air.</p><p> This device can also be used without propeller guards because they do not have much role to play in its flights but the added benefit is that removal of prop guards leads to reduced weight and hence flight time gets little improved. The overall length of propeller is about 9” and they are designed of very high quality material.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.

This drone unit is extremely stable with easy to fly options that appear much easier to beginners too. The best part is that this drone responds perfectly to transmitter with very small delay. The performance is much better as compared to many models of this price range. If we talk about the wind stability then larger size and heavier design make this drone much stable. It will rarely face an undesired flip due to unfavourable weather conditions so you need not to struggle more to keep it tuned to its normal position. Those who want a drone for aerial photography will also e able to take advantage from Syma X8C design.</p><h4 id="5-Controller-Transmitter"><a href="#5-Controller-Transmitter" class="headerlink" title="5.

It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs. Steadicams have become an essential filming tool because of how flexible they are in any situation - there’s no longer a need for specialized equipment or setups for specific shots. They are vital tools that allow you greater creative freedom with many types of images, all while achieving excellent quality footage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there"><a href="#Part-2-What-types-of-Steadicams-are-there" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?"></a>Part 2: What types of Steadicams are there?</h2><p>Three types of Steadicams are currently on the market.</p><p><strong>The Classic Steadicam:</strong> This is the original design by Garrett Brown and is still in use today.

Tighten the knob on top of the arm to secure it in place.</p><p>Next, fit the vest around your waist and tighten both straps evenly. Now you can attach the sled to your vest.

It was first invented in the 1970s by Garrett Brown. He used his background as a Hollywood director of photography with experience in major motion pictures to create the device for film production purposes. Steadicams are typically suspended from the operator’s body at chest level, known as “the shoulder mount.” The armature fits over one of the operator’s shoulders and attaches to their belt or harness around their waist while they control its movement using two handles - one for each hand.</p><p>They are generally used when shooting video in recording situations where the camera needs to move free of vibration or shake. This includes handheld, shoulder-mounted, tripod, sliders, and other stabilizing equipment.</p><p>Because of its portability, a Steadicam allows directors to shoot in locations that might otherwise not have been suitable for conventional complex camera setups. It also enables cinematographers to create moving shots, which are difficult or impossible without one. A Steadicam can also be used to “fly” through scenes by attaching the camera to a crane or dolly while allowing the operator to walk free if desired.</p><p>The Steadicam is handy in film production because it allows for stable footage even when utilizing very long lenses and uneven terrain. This means that if you are working on a budget, you can avoid spending money on equipment rentals that may not fit your schedule or needs.

We are experiencing back to back changes in operating system both from Microsoft and from the newly launched Apple’s Mac. The latest OS version from Mac, MacOS Sierra is out now. Everyone is so curious to install this OS in their Macbook. There are loads of new features available in the new OS. But, there are many people who may not want to try this latest version as full time so early.</p><p>Though, this is the latest version but this doesn’t necessarily mean you will have the best experience with it all the time. So, if you have decided to downgrade to the older version that is OS X EI Capitan, we have the step by step solution for you. The steps are really simple to perform. So, here is how to downgrade from Mac OS Sierra to OS X EI Capitan.</p><p>Ok, so before we start, I just want to tell you one thing that either open this article on a different device or take a print out if you are right now reading this article on the very machine that you want to downgrade.</p><p>So, there are basically three steps of the whole process:</p><ul><li>Erase MacOS Sierra</li><li>Re-install OS X EI Capitan</li><li>Restore your data through time machine</li></ul><p>We will cover each step one by one so that it becomes easy to understand to all of you. And one more thing, you need to have an internet connection for this. So, here is the first step for you.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Erase-MacOS-Sierra"><a href="#Erase-MacOS-Sierra" class="headerlink" title="Erase MacOS Sierra"></a>Erase MacOS Sierra</h3><p>1. First of all connect you Mac with a strong internet connection either through Wi-Fi or you can even use Ethernet connection. Make sure the connection is stable.</p><p>2. Now click on the “Apple” icon on your desktop.</p><p>3. You will see the dropdown menu there and you need to select “Restart” from the menu.</p><p>4. Now, do this step carefully. You need to hold down the Commanr+R together as soon as you hear the start up ding and keep holding till the time your computer reboots.</p><p>5. Now click on the “Disk Utility” button under the OS X Utilities section.</p><p>6. You will get the option to continue. Click on that.</p><p>7. Select your Startup Disk from the option.</p><p>8. At the top of the window you will see Earse tab. Click on that.</p><p>9. Now, enter the manes of the file you want to delete like MacOS Sierra.</p><p>10. Also select Mac OS Extended from the list and click Erase.</p><p>Once the process is completed quit the Disk Utility section from the dropdown, shown on the upper left corner of your screen. And go back to the OS X EI Capitan segment.</p><p>So, this is the end of the first step. Now we will move on to the next step that is reinstall OS X EI Capitan.</p><h3 id="Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan"><a href="#Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan" class="headerlink" title="Reinstall Os X EI Capitan"></a>Reinstall Os X EI Capitan</h3><p>Now that you have erased the present version of the OS from your Mac, you would like to install an older version for sure.</p><p>1.Go to the OS X Utilities selector and click on the “Reinstall OS X” from the dropdown.</p><p>2. Here you will see the EI Capitan installation window and click on “Continue”.</p><p>Here I would like to mention something. Depending on the date of purchase of your Mac, you may download an older version of Mac OS. You can even install the one that your Mac was shipped with. But for this you have to complete the process with Internet Recovery Mode. You can install older versions like Mavericks or Yosemite. When the installation is done open the Mac App Store. And here you will see OS X EI Capitan in your purchased list, download that. The OS will install like the standard upgrade. You have to agree with licensing terms for this.</p><p>So, we are only one step farther from the whole process to be completed. Here is the final step for you.</p><h3 id="Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine"><a href="#Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Restore your data from Time Machine"></a>Restore your data from Time Machine</h3><p>Like it is always recommended to backup your present data through Time Machine, if you have your data saved, you can use that to reinstall in the present OS that is OS X EI Capitan by following these simple steps:</p><p>1. First of all connect your Mac with internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p><p>2. Click on the “Apple” icon shown on the desktop.</p><p>3. Click on the dropdown and select Restart from the list.</p><p>4. Hold on the Command+R as soon as you hear the startup tone and hold the key till the reboot.</p><p>5. Now go to the “Restore from Time Machine Backup” in the OS X Utilities selector.</p><p>6. Click “Continue” twice and read the important information about backup before proceeding.</p><p>7. Select the Backup source where the backup data will be stored.</p><p>8. Select most recent OS X EI Capitan backup and continue.</p><p>Hah… You are done now. Your Mac will start restoring the data from Time Machine and will reboot. This may take a while depending on your system configuration. So, just sit and relax.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhance-your-digital-gallery-mastering-online-crop-functions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enhance Your Digital Gallery Mastering Online Crop Functions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastery-in-monitoring-adding-time-based-events-to-obs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastery in Monitoring Adding Time-Based Events to OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-effortlessly-record-time-lapses-on-apple-devices/"><u>[New] Effortlessly Record Time-Lapses on Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-buy-youtube-views-everything-you-need-to-know-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Buy YouTube Views - Everything You Need To Know for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-ideal-iphone-and-android-gopro-apps-cutting-edge-edits/"><u>[New] Ideal iPhone & Android GoPro Apps Cutting-Edge Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-best-sound-gear-matching-mics-with-4k-cameras/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Best Sound Gear Matching Mics with 4K Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-removing-photo-borders-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Removing Photo Borders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/fixing-common-issues-why-your-steam-games-wont-start-on-windows-10/"><u>Fixing Common Issues: Why Your Steam Games Won't Start on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-stop-mspy-from-spying-on-your-motorola-moto-g34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Motorola Moto G34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-oppo-a1-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Bypassing Google Account With vnROM Bypass For Oppo A1 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/iphone-wont-vibrate-in-quiet-or-normal-modes-discover-these-8-effective-fixes/"><u>IPhone Won't Vibrate in Quiet or Normal Modes?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Extended-Review-Straightforward-Implementation-of-HDR"><a href="#Extended-Review-Straightforward-Implementation-of-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Extended Review: Straightforward Implementation of HDR"></a>Extended Review: Straightforward Implementation of HDR</h2><p>Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos. It supports raw images and batch processing.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pricing</td><td>$33 for a lifetime license</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 and macOS 10.12 or newer</td></tr><tr><td>Layout</td><td>4.5&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use</td><td>4.8&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>HDQ quality</td><td>4.2&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Post-processing</td><td>3.5&#x2F;5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Before we dive deeper into this <strong>Easy HDRi</strong> review, let’s first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:</p><ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format.

It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975821/19272" target="_top" id="1975821">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975821" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975821/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

These specs are pretty light by modern standards, but they seem sensible for a device tailored purely to making or playing music with attached keyboards, MIDI devices, and speakers.</p><p> Per the official page, the primary purpose of the Tulip computer is to make and play music. Still, its support for Python programming also makes it capable of displaying a variety of sprites, PNGs, backgrounds, etc— which means even lightweight games should be makeable or playable on the device. There’s no real multimedia or web browsing functionality here besides. However, Tulip also has access to an exclusive BBS Tulip WORLD system for sharing music files and chatting with other users.</p><p> Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/1lYFjQp7Xrw/maxresdefault.jpg"                      alt="Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/1lYFjQp7Xrw" >Watch On <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The synthesizer at the heart of Tulip is the AMY (Addictive Music synthesizer librarY), another FOSS project made to be integrated across “almost any program, architecture, or microcontroller” and usable as an FM synthesizer, analog-type synthesizer, drum machine, or even a breakpoint synthesizer. AMY is also used by the FOSS mesh synthesizer project Alles (think FOSS wireless speaker mesh solution), which Tulip Creative Computers also supports.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> For musicians comfortable with Python or FOSS hardware and software solutions, the Tulip project seems like a nifty piece of purpose-built hardware (or software if you prefer not to buy or build anything), ideal for essential music production or simple coding projects.</p><p> When it comes to specialized hardware like this (or retro PC hardware in general), “necessity is the mother of invention” and “limitations foster creativity.” It would be interesting to see some rudimentary arcade or DOS game ports on this machine— a dual-core 250 MHz microcontroller may not sound like a lot today, but in the 80s, even 16 MHz was considered cutting-edge.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-speech-synthesis-simplified-transforming-ssaxml-into-srt-perfection/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Speech Synthesis Simplified Transforming SSA/XML Into SRT Perfection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-from-airwaves-to-your-iphone-mastery-of-podcast-downloads-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Airwaves to Your iPhone Mastery of Podcast Downloads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-beginners-basics-of-video-clarity-and-sharpness/"><u>[New] In 2024, Beginner's Basics of Video Clarity and Sharpness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-quick-start-zooming-into-success-with-win11/"><u>[New] Quick Start Zooming Into Success with Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-streaming-giants-clash-obs-meets-twitch-studio-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streaming Giants Clash OBS Meets Twitch Studio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premier-digital-classrooms-alternatives-to-udemys-model/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Premier Digital Classrooms Alternatives to Udemy's Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/5-quick-methods-to-bypass-lava-yuva-2-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>5 Quick Methods to Bypass Lava Yuva 2 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/comprehensive-techniques-for-ripping-burning-and-duplicating-your-dvds-and-cds/"><u>Comprehensive Techniques for Ripping, Burning, and Duplicating Your DVDs and CDs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/ergonomic-insights-designing-offices-that-empower-workers-outputs/"><u>Ergonomic Insights Designing Offices That Empower Workers' Outputs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-you-transfer-files-from-nokia-g42-5g-to-iphone-151413-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can You Transfer Files From Nokia G42 5G To iPhone 15/14/13?

However, with the right tools and dedication, nothing is impossible. Before creating an unboxing video, you first need to learn some basic points to eliminate the risk of adding the wrong music to any video. There are quite a few things that you should keep in mind, and you can see some of them here:</p><h3 id="1-Music-Copyright"><a href="#1-Music-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Copyright"></a>1. Music Copyright</h3><p>It is obvious that no one wants to get stuck with copyrights on unboxing videos. In the first instance, look for copyrights before adding <strong>background music for unboxing videos</strong>. You can only add music that has no copyrights, or you have permission from the musician. Other than this, copyrights alone can be a failing point for your unboxing video career.</p><p>Thus, always look for copyright marks before using any type of music. It will protect your unboxing videos and make them reputable. Royalty-free music will be a good choice in this scenario.</p><h3 id="2-Determine-the-Video’s-Style-and-Tone"><a href="#2-Determine-the-Video’s-Style-and-Tone" class="headerlink" title="2. Determine the Video’s Style and Tone"></a>2. Determine the Video’s Style and Tone</h3><p>If you add soap music to toy unboxing videos, will you think viewers will like it? Definitely not. That is why it is mandatory for you to first determine the video’s style and, after this, select the tone of your music. Select jolly and exciting music for toys and pick up music for makeup and fashion unboxing videos.</p><p>The best music for unboxing videos will make your videos more personalized and create a rhythm for your viewers. It will show the theme of your unboxing and give them a more professional and competent look.</p><h3 id="3-Appropriate-Special-Sound-Effects"><a href="#3-Appropriate-Special-Sound-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3. Appropriate Special Sound Effects"></a>3. Appropriate Special Sound Effects</h3><p>Soundtracks provide a musical structure of an unboxing video. For example, if you somehow drop the product’s box while shooting the video, you can add a funny explosion sound. It will cover your mistake and make it more fun and engaging to viewers. No one dislikes pleasurable and funny soundtracks. So, make sure you have a customized collection of impressive soundtracks to boost your viewer’s mood.</p><p>Moreover, soundtracks are not just limited to engaging viewers. They can also help deliver information, elicit excitement, add a dramatic look, and maximize production value. Using soundtracks as background music for unboxing videos is indeed a profitable idea.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484944/16446" target="_top" id="1484944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484944/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Learn-to-Imitate"><a href="#4-Learn-to-Imitate" class="headerlink" title="4.
