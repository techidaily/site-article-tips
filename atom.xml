It delivers brilliantly on some key features visual professionals want including an impressive 31.5-inch display, an IPS LCD, HDR 10 support, high-level color accuracy and depth, and the latest in DisplayPort technology.</p><p> The BenQ SW320 monitor started making waves long before it hit the market. That’s because it proposed to offer premium visual rendering functionality for a quarter of the price of its nearest high-end competitor. At roughly $1500, the SW320 is a steal for visual professionals who are keen to improve their workflow while remaining on the cutting edge of their practice.</p><p> Its 3840 x 2160px 4K display does require a powerful graphics processor to reach peak performance. The good news is that the cost of high-level graphic processing is on a downward trajectory. With a top performing monitor like the BenQ SW320, professional photographers, videographers and graphic artists can work with colors and details that are on par with nature’s artistry and their lofty creative aspirations.</p><h2 id="BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> This monitor has many positives to tally. The most notable has to be its state-of-the-art input port technologies. It sports an HDMI 2.0 port, a DisplayPort 1.4 and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. These input sockets have the necessary bandwidth to support its 4k UHD screen, its high-fidelity color renditions and its HDR functionality.</p><p> Also worthy of note is its effective stand which lets users adjust the positioning of the screen for best viewing results. On its stand, the BenQ SW320 monitor can make a 20-degree upward tilt, a 45-degree right or left swivel, and a 90-degree pivot from landscape to portrait mode.</p><p> The swivel feature does fall short of what professional studio designers may require. A photographer who needs to swivel the monitor to show a colleague her work may find a 45-degree swivel insufficient.</p><p> Another significant downside has to do with uniformity across its screen. According to some testers, the SW320 shows noticeable color tints towards the edges when set to display all-white. This is perceptible even when its Brightness Uniformity feature is enabled. While uniformity is something most monitors fail to achieve 100%, it’s not out of place to expect that a monitor as powerful and as groundbreaking as the BenQ SW320 would succeed where others have not.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The design of the BenQ SW320 is ideal for Professional photographers. It has a minimal black finish with an optimal bezel size and a matte screen surface that minimizes harsh glare.</p><p> The SW320 also has the right support apparatus. As mentioned above, it ships with a very efficient stand that provides ample support for its relatively heavy bulk. It is also a VESA compatible monitor. This means that it has standardized slots designed to let it be mounted on a wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button"                ></p><p> The most novel design feature of the SW320 is the remote-control Puck which stows seamlessly in a round slot located at the base of its stand. The puck connects to the back of the monitor and is a great convenience utility. It has the right size and bulk to fit effortlessly into any visual professional’s workflow while providing quick access to OSD menus.</p><p> With so much going for it, the BenQ SW320 has yet another functional tool many pros are sure to appreciate. It comes with a Monitor Shading Hood that blocks stray light from altering the color accuracy of images on its screen.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-ports.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-ports"                ></p><p> As discussed earlier, the SW320 is fitted with the latest input port technologies. Its HDMI 2.O port, Display port 1.4 and mini DisplayPort 1.4 are located at the lower back side of the monitor. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an AC power cable slot also located at its lower back side. The HDMI 2.0 port enables HDR support while the DisplayPort 1.4 enables full 10-bit color displays. To access these ports conveniently, users need only swivel the monitor slightly in the clockwise direction until the input panel is plainly in view.</p><p> In addition to having the right input slots to support its high-level visual performance, the SW320 also has 2 USB 3.0 slots and one SD Card slot located on its left side. BenQ takes the guesswork out of using these input slots correctly by supplying the right cables. Furthermore, there’s a cable management hole built into its stand that makes keeping a tidy set up very easy.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Color-Performance"><a href="#1-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Color Performance"></a>1. Color Performance</h4><p> High-level color performance is a major strong suit of the BenQ SW320. When it comes to the number of colors it can render, this monitor packs a powerful punch. It can display a staggering 1.07 billion colors in multiple color gamuts. It is also Technicolor certified for both color accuracy and consistency.</p><p> It supports 10-bit color display and a 14-bit color LUT, and can render 99% of the sRGB color gamut as well as 99% of the AdobeRGB color gamut. Its coverage of the AdobeRGB gamut is particularly significant because AdobeRGB has an extended blue and green gamut compared to sRGB. As a result, AdobeRGB is better at rendering colors from nature.</p><p> AdobeRGB and sRGB aside, this monitor also has additional built-in color modes such as Black and White, DCI-P3, HDR and CAD&#x2F;CAM.</p><p> What’s really impressive is how easy it is to compare images in 2 color modes on the SW320. With Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture settings, a professional photographer can compare images in different color modes side-by-side. Enabling the PIP&#x2F;PBP feature through the HotKey Puck or joystick activates BenQ’s proprietary GamutDuo. GamutDuo is the feature which supports this on-screen color-mode comparison feature.</p><p> The SW320’s HDR support is another remarkable color performance feature. High Dynamic Rate support makes it possible to render more colors in the black and white range. It’s an all-important feature of High-Definition TVs. With this feature, the SW320 can achieve picture brilliance on par with HD-TV sets and other screens designed for entertainment purposes. This level of image quality enables professionals to produce top-quality work while also advancing the realm of possibility for their craft.</p><h4 id="2-Calibration"><a href="#2-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="2. Calibration"></a>2. Calibration</h4><p> Though most powerful monitors have what it takes to render colors accurately, how well they achieve this level of performance will depend on how well and how often they’re calibrated. The same is true for the SW320 which supports external hardware calibration. BenQ has a proprietary color calibration software known as Palette Master Element. This software works well with a number of external calibration devices such as X-Rite, Spyder and Display Pro. Using the software and hardware together, the SW320 can be set to perform at optimal color fidelity and depth.</p><p> Before calibrating any BenQ SW320 straight out of the box, it’s a good idea to go over the individual performance report that ships with it. Each report is unique. It provides a reliable baseline for understanding and assessing an SW320’s performance over time. Beyond its utility, these reports are also a good indication of BenQ’s commitment to quality and excellence.</p><h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p> One could argue that the effectiveness of a device’s assembly manual is a good measure of how well it is designed. In this regard, the BenQ SW320 scores another homerun. Its illustrated assembly manual is easy to follow. This allows for a stress-free set up experience that’s bound to be reassuring to anyone who’s spent $1500 on a monitor.</p><p> In the assembly manual, each part is labelled and arrows are used effectively to show how parts fit together. This clear sequencing means that most users can assemble their SW320s themselves. Granted its assembly manual makes setting up easy, there’s no shame in asking for help and doing some research. The SW320’s Monitor Shading Hood in particular, may prove a bit more difficult to assemble than the rest of the unit.</p><h4 id="4-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#4-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Highlighted Features"></a>4. Highlighted Features</h4><p> Getting to know the strengths of the BenQ SW320 monitor is much like peeling back the layers of an onion. Many of its coolest features are nested within others and may not be apparent unless discussed. One such strength is the fact that due to its IPS LCD panel, the SW320 can display colors consistently at up to 178 degrees. This means that color depth and accuracy remain unchanged when this monitor is viewed from wide horizontally and vertically angles. This is certainly great for multi-viewer situations and in a way, compensates for the somewhat limited swivel angle of the SW320.</p><p> The Delta-E(ΔE) figures for this monitor are also very impressive and provide a sense of the high-level color fidelity it delivers consistently. Delta-E represents the difference between the color requested and the actual color rendered by the monitor. In general, figures under 2.0 are considered very good. According to some testers, the SW320 consistently scores a Delta-E that’s less than 1.2. This means that in many color modes, this monitor renders colors that are very true to what’s expected.</p><p> One last feature worth highlighting is the HotKey Puck’s custom option. It takes quick Display Menu access to a whole new level. While it is set by default to lead to standard menu options like Display, Color Adjustment and PIP&#x2F;PBP, the buttons on the Puck can actually be set to any functionality depending on what a user prefers. This includes custom color calibrations and any other custom settings a user may need in her workflow.</p><h4 id="5-Responsiveness"><a href="#5-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="5.Responsiveness"></a>5.Responsiveness</h4><p> As far as responsiveness goes, the SW320 is an okay performer. Its IPN LCD panel has a best response rate of 5ms. While this is great for rendering HD pictures and HD Video editing, it makes this monitor unsuited for quick-action gaming. Gaming monitors tend to have TN LCD panels precisely because they afford an excellent 1ms response rate that ensures screen-tearing and stuttering are minimized.</p><p> With its 5ms response rate, the SW320 may experience noticeable image rendering failures if used for fast-action gaming. For the most part however, this monitor performs exceedingly well for professional image processing and alright for minimal gaming use. It is worth emphasizing that the BenQ SW320 monitor is specifically designed to be used by visual design professionals. In light of this, its 5ms response rate is more than sufficient.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> We can all agree that the BenQ SW320 has an impressive roll of positives. Assessed by any standard, it performs superbly and delivers many pleasant surprises to boot.</p><p> With this monitor, users need not worry about being hampered by outdated hardware any time soon. The BenQ SW320 comes with the latest in display and input port technologies. Far from being left behind, the BenQ may up the demand for PCs that have powerful GPUs and the latest output ports.</p><p> For professional photographers, videographers and Graphic Designers, the SW320 is a dream. At an affordable price bracket of $1450 - $1500, this monitor puts state-of-the-art color processing features within reach. And with proprietary features like GamutDuo and Palette Master Element, Visual Professionals can optimize their workflow significantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-gpus-for-4k-edit-and-render/"><u>2024 Approved  Top GPUs for 4K Edit & Render</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-notch-animated-text-settings/"><u>2024 Approved  Top-Notch Animated Text Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-microphone-feedback-audio-recorder-for-2024/"><u>[New] Microphone Feedback  Audio Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfecting-the-bokeh-aesthetic-for-social-media-posts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfecting the Bokeh Aesthetic for Social Media Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-selecting-the-perfect-online-source-15-best-royalty-free-music-urls/"><u>In 2024, Selecting the Perfect Online Source  15 Best Royalty-Free Music URLs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-harnessing-funimates-downloading-prowess-quickly/"><u>[New] Harnessing Funimate's Downloading Prowess Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-top-websites-for-downloading-pc-games/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate List Top Websites for Downloading PC Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-create-custom-snap-layouts-in-windows-with-powertoys/"><u>How to Create Custom Snap Layouts in Windows With PowerToys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-grasp-a-wider-audience-by-multistreaming-on-youtube-and-twitch/"><u>In 2024, How to Grasp a Wider Audience by Multistreaming on Youtube and Twitch?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/gpu-purchase-woe-black-screen-encountered/"><u>GPU Purchase Woe: Black Screen Encountered</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-embedding-audio-in-instant-storytelling-platforms/"><u>In 2024, Embedding Audio in Instant Storytelling Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypass-activation-lock-on-iphone-15-pro-max-4-easy-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Bypass Activation Lock On iPhone 15 Pro Max -

Even though CPU still plays a large role in how smoothly your computer displays the videos in the video editing software, the computer’s GPU can decrease the rendering times or enhance the playback of large 4K files significantly. So, here are some background information on graphics cards.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-Graphics-Card"><a href="#What-is-a-Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="What is a Graphics Card?"></a>What is a Graphics Card?</h3><p>A graphics card or a video card is a piece of computer hardware that produces the steam of output images you can see on a computer’s monitor or any other display device. All computers feature a graphics card because without them it would be impossible to run even the most basic applications like word processors or web browsers.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards"><a href="#What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards" class="headerlink" title="What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?"></a>What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?</h3><p>There are two common types of graphics cards. Most computers have an <strong>integrated graphics card</strong> that is located on the same chip as the CPU, which enables you to edit photos, watch and edit videos or play video games. However, GPUs and CPUs that are located on the same chip often limit each other’s capabilities, and as a result, the computer needs more time to perform demanding tasks.</p><p>Installing a <strong>dedicated graphics card</strong> to your computer will eliminate lagging and it will allow you to edit videos in high resolution faster or reduce the amount of time that is required to render a 4K video. All dedicated graphics cards come with a separate chip and a separate RAM that reduces the strain of a computer’s CPU and minimizes the lagging of the footage during the video editing process.</p><p>Whether or not getting a dedicated graphics card will prove to be a good investment depends on the tasks you perform regularly on your computer. If you only edit photos and videos at a basic level, then the integrated graphics card is all you need.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you are a professional animator, video editor or simply want to play all the latest games in maximum resolution, a dedicated graphics card is going to make routine tasks you perform on your computer every day much easier and faster.</p><h3 id="Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card"><a href="#Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?"></a>Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?</h3><p>Currently, there are hundreds of different dedicated graphics card models on the market, and finding the one that is the best fit for your computer’s configuration can take some time and research. Besides checking your computer’s specifications there are a few more aspects you must consider before you purchase a dedicated graphics card.</p><h4 id="1-Power-draw"><a href="#1-Power-draw" class="headerlink" title="1. Power draw"></a>1. Power draw</h4><p>A stable power source is important for all computer configurations, as it helps you avoid system crashes and hardware malfunctions. The power usage of dedicated graphics cards varies from model to model and it can range from just 120 Watts to 300 Watts. In fact, high-end graphics cards consume as much power as all other computer components combined, and you must ensure that your computer’s power supply can provide enough power.</p><h4 id="2-Cooling"><a href="#2-Cooling" class="headerlink" title="2. Cooling"></a>2. Cooling</h4><p>Overheating can cause irreparable damage to the graphics card and to your computer, so checking the cooling capabilities of the card you would like to get can help you reduce the risk of failure in the long run. Furthermore, cooling fans on dedicated graphics cards can produce noise, and you must check if the model you’re interested in can operate at low noise levels.</p><h4 id="3-Size"><a href="#3-Size" class="headerlink" title="3. Size"></a>3. Size</h4><p>The length of most high-end dedicated graphics cards is between 10.5 and 11-inches, which can occupy two or three expansion slots.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Roadmap-to-Reigning-in-the-Realm-of-Social-Media-Management-SMM"><a href="#A-Roadmap-to-Reigning-in-the-Realm-of-Social-Media-Management-SMM" class="headerlink" title="A Roadmap to Reigning in the Realm of Social Media Management (SMM)"></a>A Roadmap to Reigning in the Realm of Social Media Management (SMM)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10. Participate in Social Media Events</strong></p><p>Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.</p><ul><li>They are a good way to get new leads.</li><li>You can also use social media events to build your brand’s reputation.</li></ul><h2 id="BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message"><a href="#BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: Just keep sending out a message"></a>BONUS: Just keep sending out a message</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key. You need to be constantly promoting yourself, not just every so often. Don’t just post a message once and assume that people will see it and buy from you because they won’t!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-4.jpg"                      alt="bonus just keep sending out message"                ></p><p>It should be easy for people to find you on social media if they want to buy your products or services. You have to keep sending out messages and posting updates until they do!</p><p>Social media can be hard work sometimes but don’t give up hope; if you keep trying, it will eventually pay off!</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, there you have it, our top tips for succeeding in social media marketing.</p><p>We hope this post has given you some ideas of how to get started with your SMM strategy and that it has given you some valuable insights into what makes a successful one.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/achieve-peak-meeting-performance-a-detailed-zoom-guide/"><u>Achieve Peak Meeting Performance  A Detailed Zoom Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-vr-unleashed-in-depth-reviews-of-peripherals/"><u>2024 Approved  VR Unleashed - In-Depth Reviews of Peripherals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-corrupt-mp4-and-avi-files-of-realme-with-video-repair-utility-on-windows-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Repair corrupt MP4 and AVI files of Realme with Video Repair Utility on Windows?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-vivo-y200-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Vivo Y200 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-and-where-to-find-a-shiny-stone-pokemon-for-apple-iphone-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How and Where to Find a Shiny Stone Pokémon For Apple iPhone SE? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-rated-web-based-solutions-for-vertical-video-editing/"><u>New In 2024, Top-Rated Web-Based Solutions for Vertical Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-banishing-bogus-buddies-from-instagram-social-structure/"><u>In 2024, Banishing Bogus Buddies From Instagram Social Structure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-connect-and-engage-strategies-for-sharing-during-fb-lives/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Connect & Engage  Strategies for Sharing During FB Lives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-android-lens-mastery-techniques-and-apps/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Android Lens Mastery  Techniques & Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/1716183954753-new-in-2024-how-to-reverse-image-search-instagram/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Reverse Image Search Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/ispoofer-is-not-working-on-infinix-zero-30-5g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iSpoofer is not working On Infinix Zero 30 5G?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Achieve-Peak-Meeting-Performance-A-Detailed-Zoom-Guide"><a href="#Achieve-Peak-Meeting-Performance-A-Detailed-Zoom-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Achieve Peak Meeting Performance: A Detailed Zoom Guide"></a>Achieve Peak Meeting Performance: A Detailed Zoom Guide</h2><p>A few weeks ago, I saw an ad for Zoom in the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris while making a transfer from Lisbon Portugal. The first thing I thought about was how much money Zoom must be making. Even before the pandemic, Zoom was becoming a market leader in a way that GoToMeeting was previously – primarily from their awesome ease of use.</p><p>Heck, “Zoom” has even become a modern verb, as in, “Hey, let’s jump on a Zoom!”</p><p>One of the recent changes with Zoom is that videos being recorded are now announced as such when you come into the room for privacy reasons. It’s good practice to record all your Zoom meetings. I’ve been able to get testimonials from my clients by recording Zooms.</p><p>Video quality is important because you only get one chance. The source you record with cannot be upgraded in terms of quality. So, if your initial recording is poor, you’re going to be stuck with a subpar recording.</p><p>When recording, think about both your video quality, and the other Zoom participants you might want to record.</p><p>We all know and use Zoom, but there are some tricks you can use to make your videos look even better. Here are some simple tips to get a better-quality video recording from Zoom.</p><h2 id="Turn-on-HD"><a href="#Turn-on-HD" class="headerlink" title="Turn on HD"></a>Turn on HD</h2><p>HD video is disabled in Zoom by default. Obviously, HD requires more bandwidth and online space, so it’s easy to see why this is not enabled by default. So if you have not, be sure to enable HD video.</p><p>You can do that under Preferences -&gt; video. There is a button to toggle on HD. Toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/turn-on-hd-camera-zoom.jpg"                      alt="turn on hd camera zoom"                ></p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: periodically check that this has not been disabled when you update to new versions of Zoom.</p><h2 id="Touch-up-Your-Appearance"><a href="#Touch-up-Your-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Touch up Your Appearance"></a>Touch up Your Appearance</h2><p>Next, under “My Video” click “touch up my appearance.” This will add a slider you can adjust to get the best picture quality. You will see your webcam in real time adjust as you toggle and play with these features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/touch-up-my-appearance-zoom.jpg"                      alt="touch up my appearance zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Adjust-for-Low-Light"><a href="#Adjust-for-Low-Light" class="headerlink" title="Adjust for Low Light"></a>Adjust for Low Light</h2><p>Not everyone has a ring light, but nearly every scene could benefit from the low light adjustment. This uses AI technology to boost the light making a better quality recording in the vast majority of situations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adjust-for-low-light-zoom.jpg"                      alt="adjust for low light zoom"                ></p><p>People tend to underestimate the power of good lighting in improving your video quality. Not only is brighter usually better when it comes to lighting but if you record with better light, it gives you more options for adjusting the video quality later on in post-production.</p><h2 id="Optimize-Video-Quality"><a href="#Optimize-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Optimize Video Quality"></a>Optimize Video Quality</h2><p>Under the advanced settings, there is a toggle called “Optimize video quality with de-noise.” Make sure this is toggled on. This uses AI software-based noise removal to help improve the video quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/optimize-video-quality-zoom.jpg"                      alt="optimize video quality zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Use-a-USB-mic"><a href="#Use-a-USB-mic" class="headerlink" title="Use a USB mic"></a>Use a USB mic</h2><p>Have you ever seen a video with really poor sound quality? It makes a huge difference in how you judge the quality of that video. So if you have a USB mic, use that instead of the built-in microphone. Viewers will subconsciously judge the quality of the video not only on video quality, but also on sound quality. It makes a massive difference to the final video recording.</p><h2 id="Use-a-Virtual-Background"><a href="#Use-a-Virtual-Background" class="headerlink" title="Use a Virtual Background"></a>Use a Virtual Background</h2><p>A cluttered background is never ideal in videos. That’s why the rage on YouTube is to use a camera (Like the Canon M50 for example) that naturally provides a bokeh effect, which is a gentle blurring of the background.</p><p>The reason this is so critical is it helps the viewer focus on what is important - which is your speaker.</p><p>So Under “Backgrounds &amp; Effects” choose a virtual background, or the “blur” option to help improve your source video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-virtual-background-zoom.jpg"                      alt="use virtual background zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting"><a href="#Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Be aware of the different views during your meeting"></a>Be aware of the different views during your meeting</h2><p>Zoom records with a single video file, unlike other software options such as Ecamm or Skype Call Recorder. This means the recording will be very similar to what you see.</p><p>When you are in a meeting, you can toggle between the Gallery view, which shows everyone in the meeting in tiles, and the Speaker view, which shows the main speaker in a full-screen mode.</p><p>The recording will record exactly what is on the screen, so if you want to get some variety, you can toggle between these two during your recording.</p><p>There is also a “Highlight” feature where you can manually select a participant to be highlighted regardless if they are the active speaker or not.</p><p>Here’s another tip. You can choose to hide the participants who don’t have a video stream by adjusting one of the video settings Check “Hide non-video participants.”</p><h2 id="Wipe-your-webcam"><a href="#Wipe-your-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Wipe your webcam"></a>Wipe your webcam</h2><p>Webcams can pick up dust and oil from time to time. So before important recordings (and also because my kids sometimes use my laptop) I usually wipe my webcam with a lint-free microfiber cloth before important Zooms with my colleagues and clients.</p><p>I use the same type of cloth that I use for cleaning my eyeglasses. Keep it simple and clean!</p><h2 id="Upgrade-your-camera"><a href="#Upgrade-your-camera" class="headerlink" title="Upgrade your camera"></a>Upgrade your camera</h2><p>You can add a better webcam or even a mirrorless camera, like the Canon M50 that is popular with YouTubers as a webcam input. Once you have added the camera, you can select which webcam you want to use from the dropdown menu.</p><h2 id="Organize-your-Zooms"><a href="#Organize-your-Zooms" class="headerlink" title="Organize your Zooms"></a>Organize your Zooms</h2><p>If you do use your Zooms in your video editing, I would recommend renaming the video file or Zoom folder after your meeting. This doesn’t affect the video quality, but it sure allows the experience of video editing to go much smoother when you know exactly which file you are looking for.</p><h2 id="Final-bonus-tip"><a href="#Final-bonus-tip" class="headerlink" title="Final bonus tip"></a>Final bonus tip</h2><p>Remember, bring energy to what you say. Good energy will raise the quality of ANY video recording. It doesn’t matter if you are giving a lecture, teaching on your Zoom, or giving a sales pitch. Energy is what makes video impactful.</p><p>So there you have some of my favorite tips for boosting the quality of your Zoom recordings. So what are your favorite tips for using Zoom?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-vr-unleashed-in-depth-reviews-of-peripherals/"><u>2024 Approved  VR Unleashed -

The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1. Top Windows 10 Features"></a>1. Top Windows 10 Features</h4><p>With Windows 10, it would seem as though Microsoft actually listened to people. The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2. More Windows 10 Features</h4><p>The above three features are good examples of what Windows 10 will bring to the table, but that’s not it by a long shot:</p><p><strong>Xbox App and Streaming</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/xboy-games-windows10-1.png"                      alt="xbox games windows10"                ></p><p>Windows 10 will include an exciting Xbox app, which will come loaded with possibilities. The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games.

And if we talk about 1080p resolution level then frame rate of Hero4 Black is exactly twice as that of Ghost S because the former one serves with 120fps and later can go up to 60fps only.</p><p> Need to correct the fisheye in the post production?

Battery Life"></a>4.  Battery Life</h4><p> Hero4 Black consists of a removable 1160mAh battery that can work up to one hour and 5 minutes with 4K resolution and if you record at 1080p&#x2F;30fps then this battery life can be extended up to 1.5 hours only. In case of Drift Ghost S you have 1700 mAh battery that can work up to 3.5 hours while recording videos at 1080p&#x2F;30fps. If you switch on the WiFi during recording then battery life is automatically decayed in Hero4 Black.</p><h4 id="5-WaterProof"><a href="#5-WaterProof" class="headerlink" title="5.  WaterProof"></a>5.  WaterProof</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Ghost S device is waterproof even without any additional housing arrangement so it also provides much better audio quality. This action cam can go under water up to 3 m without any housing whereas if you attach housing then it allows recording up to 60m. On the other side, Hero4 Black is not water proof at all and even with the additional housing you can take it up to 40 m below water.</p><p> Want to know more action cameras with waterproof capacity?<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check Top 7 Best Waterproof Action Camera For 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Scene-Mode"><a href="#5-Scene-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5.  Scene Mode"></a>5.  Scene Mode</h4><p> Drift comes with few additional scene modes: Low Light, Vivid and Normal. Low light mode assists in better clarity during night hours, Vivid helps to push up color information whereas normal mode add more natural colors to footage. On the other side, Hero4 Black comes with only one scene mode that is Low Light. It helps to develop better resolution at night so that more details can be accessed.</p><h4 id="6-Video-Tagging-Ghost-S-and-HiLight-Tag-GoPro"><a href="#6-Video-Tagging-Ghost-S-and-HiLight-Tag-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="6.

Video Tagging (Ghost S) and HiLight Tag (GoPro)</h4><p> The GoPro Hero4 Black device is designed with one additional feature named as HiLight Tagging where by pressing the side button you can allow the application to automatically mark the special moments in video footage.</p><p> The video tagging feature in Ghost S allows users to save the highlighted moments separately in the whole video so that they can be easily recognized later. This feature can be applied to all current, future and past videos.</p><h4 id="8-App"><a href="#8-App" class="headerlink" title="8.  App"></a>8.  App</h4><p> Hero4 Black works with GoPro App that assists in easy connectivity over smartphones and also helps in remote navigation. The same feature is supported by Ghost S with its own Drift App that works over iOS and Android platform. GoPro Application also supports Window platform along with iOS and Android.</p><h4 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h4><p> The only major question that you must ask yourself before selection of camera is whether you need a 4K resolution or not? Because if it is your requirement then you have to go for Hero4 Black but as all other features are equally comparable so otherwise users can prefer to buy Ghost S device. If you are looking for a perfect companion that can be mounted on helmet then Ghost S is right choice for you.</p><p> Want to learn more about Ghost-S?<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check Drift Innocations Ghost-S Action Camera Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visionary-recording-devices-top-18-camcorders-best/"><u>2024 Approved  Visionary Recording Devices - Top 18 Camcorders' Best</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/best-action-hunting-cameras-of-2023/"><u>Best Action Hunting Cameras of 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-guide-to-outstanding-tiktok-content-via-computerios/"><u>[Updated] Guide to Outstanding TikTok Content via Computer/iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-call-logs-from-infinix-smart-8-hd-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>How To  Restore Missing Call Logs from Infinix Smart 8 HD</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-online-gallery-guide-sites-and-plugins-for-superb-photoframes/"><u>[Updated] Online Gallery Guide  Sites & Plugins for Superb Photoframes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gaming-galore-top-websites-to-download-games/"><u>2024 Approved Gaming Galore Top Websites to Download Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-audiophiles-recorder-review/"><u>[New] In 2024, Audiophile's Recorder Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-app-on-poco-f5-pro-5g-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to Recover Deleted Photos from Android Gallery App on Poco F5 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premier-screenshots-software-for-linux-users/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Premier Screenshots Software for Linux Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/overcoming-unnatural-motion-blur-in-uav-videos/"><u>Overcoming Unnatural Motion Blur in UAV Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-streamlining-gameplay-logs-for-social-media-sharing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Streamlining Gameplay Logs for Social Media Sharing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-instagram-voice-transformation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering the Art of Instagram Voice Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-to-avi-mastery-top-8-convertors-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] YouTube to AVI Mastery  Top 8 Convertors Reviewed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The Sony FDRA53&#x2F;B 4K camcorder is by no means an exception. The camcorder is equipped with Sony’s state of the art image stabilization technology that helps you create crystal clear footage even when the camera is shaking. This 4K camcorder is light and easy to use, but many of its options are automatic, which prevents the user from controlling all the parameters during the recording session.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01950TCEU/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01950TCEU&linkId=e935032c98c66b35920d601b25a0bb11" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="2-Sony-FDR-AX33-4K"><a href="#2-Sony-FDR-AX33-4K" class="headerlink" title="2.

Optical zoom can go as high as 20X in both HD and 4K modes, while the Clear Image Zoom feature can provide an additional artificial zoom boost to 30X zoom for 4K and 40X zoom for HD. The Sony FDR-AX33 4K camcorder is an excellent and above all affordable choice for average users who are not in need of the high-end professional equipment.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R5LH9G0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00R5LH9G0&linkId=bccccf2ac73c9a6b193fdbc1bdd39ae9" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="3-Sony-FDR-AX100-B-4K"><a href="#3-Sony-FDR-AX100-B-4K" class="headerlink" title="3.

Although the camcorder features a G lens with 20X optical zoom, the lens isn’t interchangeable. The Sony PXW-Z100 4K is capable of recording true 4K 4096x2160 resolution videos at up to 50 and 60fps. It utilizes Sony’s XVAC 4:2:2 recording format, which means that converting the footage into a video format that can be easily played or distributed through the Internet can take a significant amount of time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IDV0KKS/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00IDV0KKS&linkId=0c2609a0a54e30d1a8251493875c6b6d" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="5-Sony-PXW-Z150-4K"><a href="#5-Sony-PXW-Z150-4K" class="headerlink" title="5.

Easy to take with"></a>1. Easy to take with</h4><p>Most camcorders available on the market today are easy to carry around, so when buying a 4K camcorder you should think about how easy the model you are planning on buying is to carry around. Also, keep in mind that lightweight cameras are more difficult to hold still.</p><h4 id="2-Wide-lens-and-large-sensors"><a href="#2-Wide-lens-and-large-sensors" class="headerlink" title="2. Wide lens and large sensors"></a>2. Wide lens and large sensors</h4><p>The sensor of a camera is perhaps its most important part. The 1-inch sensor pretty much enables you to record video in any light conditions. Most of the 4K camcorders have integrated wide angle lenses, but it is important to find out what the lens on your camcorder can and cannot do.</p><h4 id="3-Built-in-viewfinder"><a href="#3-Built-in-viewfinder" class="headerlink" title="3. Built-in viewfinder"></a>3. Built-in viewfinder</h4><p>As great as camera displays are, they are not always reliable and you can’t always be sure that the images you are seeing on the display are going to look like that once you transfer them onto your hard drive. A good viewfinder can help you to make sure that your videos are not overexposed or underexposed and that your footage is always in focus.</p><h4 id="4-Optical-Zoom"><a href="#4-Optical-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="4. Optical Zoom"></a>4. Optical Zoom</h4><p>Using a camera often means that you want to record something that is not near you. Sometimes you might want to film only a detail, but without a proper lens, this task is impossible. 4K camcorders do not have interchangeable lenses which is why an optical zoom can be crucial in situations when you want to record something that is out of your reach. Most 4K camcorders also have a digital zoom, but digital zoom reduces the picture quality and it is best to avoid using it.</p><h4 id="5-Image-stabilization"><a href="#5-Image-stabilization" class="headerlink" title="5. Image stabilization"></a>5. Image stabilization</h4><p>Capturing motion isn’t as easy as it sounds. Moving objects tend to create a blur, which is why Image stabilization techniques are such an important factor that determines the quality of any camera. Camera shake can result in unusable footage and if you are looking to buy a 4K camcorder make sure that the camera you wish to purchase has a superb Image stabilization.</p><h4 id="6-External-Microphone-Jack"><a href="#6-External-Microphone-Jack" class="headerlink" title="6. External Microphone Jack"></a>6. External Microphone Jack</h4><p>Internal camera sound is often too terrible to be used in the post-production. If you’d like to record professional sound for your videos make sure that the 4K camcorder has at least one XLR jack.</p><h4 id="7-Night-Vision"><a href="#7-Night-Vision" class="headerlink" title="7.

While physical offices are closed, services like Zoom for win10, which provide online meetings and video conversations, are more important than ever for keeping organizations operating effectively.

How to Download Zoom Desktop Client"></a>Part 1. How to Download Zoom Desktop Client</h2><p>A popular trend, particularly in the last two years, is working from home. Although the Basic plan that is free has a 40-minute time restriction on group meetings, Zoom is accessible for download for free. However, you are permitted to hold an infinite number of one-on-one meetings and group meetings with up to 100 participants.

As opposed to conventional offices and schools, Zoom also makes it feasible and simpler to capture a screen during a conference. It is important to understand how to download it because of this.</p><p>Step1Launch the web browser on your computer and go to Zoom.us to access the Zoom website. In the website’s footer, at the bottom of the page, click Download tab and the options are visible as follows:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-client-download-center.jpg"                      alt="zoom client download center"                ></p><p>Step2Now, on the “Zoom Client for Meetings” tab of the Download Center, click “Download.” Afterwards, allow the app to make changes to your PC by pressing Run as shown below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authorize-zoom-install.jpg"                      alt="authorize zoom install"                ></p><p>Step3After that, the Zoom software will start downloading.

How to Use Zoom on Windows PC"></a>Part 2. How to Use Zoom on Windows PC</h2><p>One of the most well-liked options for video conferencing is Zoom. Cross-platform compatibility is one of the factors contributing to its success. Instead of installing a program on their PCs, Zoom also allows users to attend a meeting through a Web browser.

If we talk about the fine details then its colour information is stunning enough while native 4K disc edge offers fast Amazon and Netflix connectivity. The 4K HDR ability re-writes the AV setup options so one cannot use traditional test patterns for its image balancing while viewing HDR content. The best trick is to navigate as per player modes as it consists of a coupled HDR input mode that ensures perfect integrity of HDR signal.</p><p> There are numbers of picture modes within tools menu as like User, Movie, Standard and Dynamic. Most of the users may think about Movie mode as their first preference for quality results but the tests show that lots of important audio information is lost during this mode. In case of standard settings, you will be able to avail better subtitle detailing however, contrast and brightness options are equally good in Movie mode. In simple words, selection of right mode highly depends upon user needs and options to make compromises.</p><p> Now, here is one important thing to note that if you try to watch standard blu-ray content with same HDMI input and same content settings then image will naturally get degraded. This happens due to unwanted scaling of image. The best way to get your desired output level is to make adjustments for user settings of this player. It will help you to develop better results for 1080p Blu-ray content but note that switching between viewing modes like this will become complicated if you are not able to remember right disc formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-3.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p> In simple words, Samsung UBD-K8500 is one of the best devices for your Ultra HD TV needs. It possesses a comprehensive set of all good features with an easy to operate package. You may find its fan and disc tray little noisy but the simple to use interface and stunning remote control abilities again create remarkable results.

Iris scanner, curved displays and new aspect ratio, it has everything that can make a new model stand out against a big crowd in the market. Moto Z2 is designed with a unique design that focuses on Motos Mods and the high tech back panel provides new functionality. This phone is compatible with almost all carriers of the US, provides impressive battery performance and you will also be able to get a high-quality headphone jack option.

MOTO Z2 Play Price and Availability"></a>1. MOTO Z2 Play Price and Availability</h4><p>Moto Z2 has released into the market on July 6 and it is now available on several online stores via Verizon. In the US, for the course of total 24 months, you can get Moto Z2 with payment of $17&#x2F;month. Within a few weeks, people can avail this smartphone with a price tag of $499 only in the nearby retail stores.</p><h4 id="2-MOTO-Z2-Play-Design"><a href="#2-MOTO-Z2-Play-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. MOTO Z2 Play Design"></a>2. MOTO Z2 Play Design</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/moto-z2-play-design.jpg"                      alt="moto-z2-play-design"                ></p><p>Moto Z2 is currently available in four attractive colors, gray, gold, blue and black. This smartphone appears almost similar to Play Droid and Moto Z Droid when we talk about design. You will find a band of metal on side portions of this device along with the power button and volume buttons. The back panel is finished with the matte metal appearance and you will also notice the camera bump as well as few magnetic attachment pins that are dedicated to Moto Mods. The total dimension of this device is 6.1x3.0x02 inches and the overall weight goes up to 5.1 ounces. Well designed bezels are added to the upper and lower portion of the screen but they make it quite hard to operate devices with one-handed operation. It also contains a headphone jack and a USB-C charging slot at the bottom portion whereas the top portion handles MicroSD card and SIM card slot. The memory card capacity is extendable up to 256GB. With a well-designed water repellent coating, this smartphone becomes capable enough to resists splashes. Screen brightness for this device is well adjusted so that users can access it well even at outdoor locations. Colors are often distributed with saturated and deep ambiance whereas with night mode enabled you can expect warmer tones with fine color temperature adjustment.</p><h4 id="3-MOTO-Z2-Play-Hardware"><a href="#3-MOTO-Z2-Play-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="3. MOTO Z2 Play Hardware"></a>3. MOTO Z2 Play Hardware</h4><p>If you have already used Moto Z Play and Moto Z then you will definitely find this new model just like a hybrid of both these predecessors. The frame appearance is well improved with a smooth aluminum finish on the body. It works with snapdragon 626 that provides a 10% faster speed as compared to Z play that use to work on 625. You will be able to find 4GB RAM along with an internal storage space of 64GB. As 626 is not able to support larger displays screens so it is limited to 5.5 inches with a resolution rating of 1080p. Other than the screen, you will find a few aesthetic differences in this device as compared to the predecessors. The new round shape of the fingerprint sensor looks quite impressive and its wider design assists in easy activation. The battery shell for this device is 17% lesser where you will find 3000mAh battery but this design selection leads to a slimmer look for Moto Z2.</p><h4 id="4-MOTO-Z2-Play-Camera"><a href="#4-MOTO-Z2-Play-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4. MOTO Z2 Play Camera"></a>4. MOTO Z2 Play Camera</h4><p>You will find the front camera of Moto Z2 somewhat comparable to its predecessor but yes it’s quite good. On the other side, the rear camera is G5’d that has faced a major fall drop 16MP to only 12MP but at the same time, the aperture has been expanded to f&#x2F;1.7 range. Manufacturers have also merged the phase detection autofocus and dual focus pixel option into this device to make its camera performance more accurate. You will definitely feel impressed with its daylight shots as they deliver higher accuracy, impactful brightness, and stunning sharpness. At the same time, we didn’t find any trouble in its low light performance because it was capable enough to adjust focus to a much better level even with challenging light situations. The only trouble noticed about Moto Z2 is its camera speed; the old image processor technology is not capable enough to stay tuned to today’s desired digital speeds. This camera also finds some difficulty to boost up the ISO level on time so that blurry subjects can be avoided and shutter speed can deliver accurate performance.</p><h4 id="4-MOTO-Z2-Play-Battery"><a href="#4-MOTO-Z2-Play-Battery" class="headerlink" title="4. MOTO Z2 Play Battery"></a>4. MOTO Z2 Play Battery</h4><p>Moto Z Play was well rated for its superb battery performance in 2016; the same quality is continued for the new Moto Z2 design. It can easily last for 2 days when you operate this device with the attachment of Moto Mod Battery. You will be glad to know that Moto Z2 provides little higher battery performance as compared to its predecessor and it happens just because of the addition of 10% higher clock speed for this new chipset. So, we can say that performance of Z2 is little upgraded when compared to the older series devices of Moto. This phone is observed to work well up to 8 hours and 18 minutes even if the person keeps on watching full-screen videos with maximum brightness level over LTE. In case if you need more power then you should switch to TurboPower Pack mode that can provide an excellent boost over performance. Also, you can avail fast charging feature with its included Turbo Power adapter.</p><h4 id="5-MOTO-Z2-Play-Network-Connectivity"><a href="#5-MOTO-Z2-Play-Network-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="5. MOTO Z2 Play Network Connectivity"></a>5. MOTO Z2 Play Network Connectivity</h4><p>Z2 extends support to LTE bands, UMTS, GSM and CDMA. This device allows users to easily operate on US carriers while including services for Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&amp;T. During the T-Mobile testing, this device delivered an awesome performance for uploading and downloading with value falling somewhere around 17.6Mbps and 14.3 Mbps respectively. Other protocols for connectivity include NFC, Bluetooth 4.2 and dual-band Wi-Fi. It provides decent performance for phone calls as voice transmission is observed to be quite impressive. It provides great noise cancellation property and conversations were just fine. The earpiece option is quite impressive with distortion-free sound transfer that suits best for the noisy environments.</p><h4 id="6-MOTO-Z2-Play-Software"><a href="#6-MOTO-Z2-Play-Software" class="headerlink" title="6. MOTO Z2 Play Software"></a>6. MOTO Z2 Play Software</h4><p>This device is loaded with Android 7.1 Nougat. You will be able to find some of the most popular Moto apps in this smartphone like Moto Voice, Moto Display and Moto Actions etc along with Google Pixel XL. Although all the older smartphones of Moto series are going to have new software updates by this year Moto Z2 is already found to have all the latest features in it. You will be glad to know that this recently launched Moto device is designed with Thumbnail quick access feature so you need not unlock your phone every time. There is no doubt to say that Motorola has reflected the best improvement for display technology and it is now going to give a great competition to Google, LG and Samsung. One more interesting feature added to Moto Z2 by this year is its “Show Me” that works in assistance with Moto Voice Suite. With this advanced application, users can easily launch any application on screen by just saying “Show Me X”. Everything on this phone appears really good and simple to use. You can access weather, twitter and routine schedule etc by simply using voice commands with Voice Search API. The screen scaling options for this device are also much improved so now you can easily fit more icons on the device screen. You will definitely love the launcher as it leads to impressive performance. You will definitely love to use its gesture-based control ability where twist opens the camera, chopping opens flashlight and if you swipe down the screen then it will automatically enable one-handed operation for Moto Z2 screen.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>With the price tag of $499, Moto Z2 offers an impressive set of features. The long battery life, great aesthetics and its ability to handle all US carriers very well make it suitable for all android lovers. The greater flexibility for application management and advanced software updates make Moto Z2 the best choice for your next purchase.
