It helps in making the audial join smooth and avoids rough ends or disturbance in the output. Most commonly, fade effects are considered by professionals. In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –

● Constant power

● Constant gain

● Exponential fade
