## Enjoy Dual Views: Expert Tips for Utilizing Picture-in-Picture on Netflix

Video and movie **streaming** has become a common amenity in modern life. Because of **apps**, watching a series or a movie can be done with only a few taps.

Anything is possible with the Netflix **picture-in-picture** feature.

You can comfortably text, mail, or browse the internet while comfortably watching a video on Netflix. Here is the ultimate guide to using the feature across different platforms.

## Part 1\. How to Enable Picture-in-Picture on Netflix on Desktop

1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
