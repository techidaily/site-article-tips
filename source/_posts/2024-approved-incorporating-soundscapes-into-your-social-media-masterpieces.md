## Conclusion

If you're looking to add music to your Instagram videos, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, make sure that the music you choose is appropriate for your content. Some videos might be better suited for a fast-paced pop song, while others might be better suited for a more mellow tune. Music must be short enough to fit within the given time limit.

Music can enhance the Instagram experience for both the user and those who view their content. Music can add emotion, feeling, and atmosphere to posts, and it can also help people connect. While it is possible to add music to Instagram posts through third-party apps, the best way to do so is by using the built-in music feature.
