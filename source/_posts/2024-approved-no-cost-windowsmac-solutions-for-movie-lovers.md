## Part 2: DVD Video Player Software FAQs

#### 1\. What is a DVD player?

A DVD player can either be a device that is designed for the playback of audio and video DVDs or a media player that enables you to open a DVD on a computer. A DVD player is a hardware that can be connected to a television set, and enables you to watch movies or listen to music from your home entertainment system.

A DVD player can also be a software product that allows you to view DVDs on your computer’s display.

#### 2\. Which video files can be played on a DVD player?

The answer to this question depends on the DVD player you’re using because the list of supported file formats varies from one DVD player to another. However, most DVD players on the market support MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MOV, DivX, and other commonly used file formats.

If you cannot open a DVD video with the DVD media player you have on your computer, you should check if the media player supports the file format in which the video you’re trying to open is saved and make sure that you have all the necessary codecs.

#### 3\. Which video file format is the best for DVD player?

Ideally, the video you’re trying to open will already be saved in the file format that preserves the file’s quality. In case you are burning a video to a DVD, you should either opt for the MPEG-4, MOV, MP4 depending on the type of disc you are making and the purpose for which you are going to use it.

Avoid choosing video file formats that may compromise the quality of the original video.

#### 4\. Does Windows 10 come with a DVD player?

Yes, it does. PC owners that have Windows 10 installed can open DVDs with Windows DVD Player. So, all you have to do in order to open a DVD disc on Windows 10 is to insert a DVD disc into the computer’s optical drive.

However, earlier versions of the OS don’t always come with Windows DVD Player, which means that you have to search for a third-party app if you want to play DVD on your PC.
