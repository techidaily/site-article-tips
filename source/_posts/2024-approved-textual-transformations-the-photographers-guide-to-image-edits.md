Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:

This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances.

### 3\. Look for Negative Space

### 4\. Framing the Text

If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.

### 2\. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties

It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won't tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.

![blend text with image properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-10.jpg)

### 3\. Look for Negative Space

When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering. Often referred to as negative space, utilizing that space for the text may be the perfect way that you can consider writing a text on photos. This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Framing the Text

If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.

### 5\. Control your Sizes and Styles
