## Part 1: More Details on Google Podcasts

So, **what is Google Podcast App** and what users can expect from the software. The mobile-based application from Google is made mainly for podcasts, finding relevant ones, and posting your episodes on a personalized channel.

* **Cost**: Free
* **Supported integrations**: Google products like Google Home and Google Assistant.
* **Supported OS**: [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-podcasts/id1398000105) (iOS), [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.podcasts&gl=US) (Android), [Web](https://podcasts.google.com/)

![google podcast app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-google-podcast-app-1.jpg)

The podcasts available in the app were originally in Google Play Music. But after its discontinuation in 2020, the podcasts have moved to this separate platform. However, the links of the available shows and branding have become new, so it is important to update that information on your channel and transfer the audience there. As for this app itself, it is still ongoing.
