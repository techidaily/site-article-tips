You can only export your video in SD quality using a free version. To export it in HD, FHD, and 4K resolution, you must purchase the premium version of it. Moreover, you cannot select the frame rate above 30 in the free version.

#### **Paid features:**

As we have described, not all this application's features are free. Some of them are premium which requires you to buy their premium version. Using its free version is a big drawback, as it develops mainly to make users buy its premium version.

#### **Watermark:**

The biggest con of using VideoShow is that they also put their watermark on the exported videos, which ruins the quality and look of your videos.
