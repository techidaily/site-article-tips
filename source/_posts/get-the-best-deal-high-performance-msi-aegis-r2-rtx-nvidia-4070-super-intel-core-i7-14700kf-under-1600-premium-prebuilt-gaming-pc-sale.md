## Exclusive Offer: High-End Gaming Beast (RTX 4070 Super GPU + I7 CPU) Prebuilt PC From MSI for Less Than $1,600 - Limited Time Only

Today's deal is on a prebuilt gaming PC that's ready to game as soon as you plug it in. If building your own gaming rig isn't your thing, you don't know that much about PC building, or you perhaps don't want any hassle in setting either yourself or a family member up with a new gaming PC, then this deal has you covered. With a mix of great component choices and an excellent price point, this is one of the[best prebuilt gaming PC](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-gaming-pcs) deals I've seen of late.

 The[MSI Aegis RS2 gaming desktop (model: C14NUE7-824US) is now only $1,599](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=tomshardware-us-7104703477153757966&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmsi-aegis-rs2-c14nue7-824us%2Fp%2FN82E16883151419) at Newegg after a $300 discount. As an added bonus, you can pick up a copy of the controversially priced upcoming_Star Wars Outlaws_ game from Ubisoft. As far as I can tell, this is a digital code for the standard edition tier of the game and is listed at $69 for pre-order directly from Ubisoft. This is a bundle offer add-on that can be redeemed due to the system containing a qualifying Intel CPU.

 Inside the MSI Aegis RS2 is an Intel Core i7-14700KF processor, an Nvidia RTX 4070 Super graphics card with 12GB of GDDR6X VRAM, 16GB of 5600 MHz DDR5 RAM, a 2TB SSD for your games library, a 360mm AIO cooler, a 750-watt power supply, and Wi-Fi 7, all wrapped in an MSI GUNGNIR 212R PC case. This a pretty good value-for-money configuration at this price and these components will certainly allow this PC to power through any game you throw at it.
