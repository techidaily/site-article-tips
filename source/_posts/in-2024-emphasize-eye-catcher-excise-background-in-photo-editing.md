### How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer

To erase a white background in Affinity Designer, do these steps:

Step1 In the first step, install the [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)software and launch it on your computer. Go to **"File" > "Open"** and head to the location of your image with a white background on your drive to import it.

Now access the **Pixel Persona** section in the left corner of the software screen by clicking the **colored boxes** icon.

Step2 Go to the **"Layers"** tab in the right pane, right-click your layer, and disable **"Lock."** Now right-click on your layer again, and select **"Rasterize"** to enable editing of specific parts of the image.

![unlocking the image layer in affinity designer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unlocking-the-image-layer-in-affinity-designer.png)

Step3 To make a selection around your subject, first enable the **"Snap To Edges"** and **"Soft Edges"** feature from the top toolbar. This will help you automatically detect the edges and give it a more tapered finish.

![enabling snap to edges and soft edges in affinity designer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/enabling-snap-to-edges-and-soft-edges-in-affinity-designer.png)

Set your brush size using your keyboard's **left** and **right bracket** keys. Now, manually make a selection around your subject and white edges in the image as precisely as possible.

Step4 Next, zoom in on your subject. Press & hold the ALT key on your keyboard, and use the Selection Brush tool to manually correct the rough edges of your outline.

Click the **"Refine"** option in the toolbar to open the **"Refine Selection"** menu. A red mask will be applied to your subject, giving you an idea of how your image will look once you remove the background. Zoom in and if any details are excluded, paint them over. Once you are satisfied, click **"Apply"** to save your changes.

Step5 In the last step, press the **"Delete"** key on your keyboard to remove the background, or click **"Edit"** and choose the **"Cut"** option.

Now, hit **"Control+D"** to deselect the selection. Alternatively, you can click **"Select"** in the top toolbar and choose the **"Deselect"** option. Finally, you can export your file using the **"File" > "Export"** option.

### How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer

If you want to remove a busy background of an image in the Affinity Designer software, follow these steps carefully:

Step1 Click the **"File"** option in Affinity Designer and select **"Open"** from the drop-down menu. Select your image and click **"Open"** to import your picture.

From the right-side panel, open the **Layers** tab and click the **"Lock"** icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select **"Rasterize & Trim."** Rasterization will help remove the background.

Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object/subject in the picture. Click the **"Selection Brush"** tool from the left-side panel to do so.

Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the **Right** and **Left Bracket** keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.

Step3 Once you've made a selection around your object, it's time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the **"Refine"** option from the top toolbar to open the **"Refine Selection"** menu.

Focus on the **Foreground** and **Background** brushes in the **Refine Selection** menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the **Right or Left Bracket** key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.  
Once satisfied with your changes, click the **"Apply"** option in the **Refine Selection** menu to save your settings.

Step4 Now that you've outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it's time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the **Delete key** on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.

If you are using a Mac system, click **"Edit"** in the toolbar and select **"Cut"** from the drop-down menu. Your background will be removed and changed to a checkboard pattern.

Step5 In this last step, you must deselect the outline around your subject. For this, press the **"Control+D"** key on your keyboard or click **"Select"** in the toolbar and choose the **"Deselect"** option.

Finally, click **"File"** and select the **"Export"** option from the drop-down menu. Then, in the Export Settings menu, choose PNG and click **"Export"** to save your file on your PC.
