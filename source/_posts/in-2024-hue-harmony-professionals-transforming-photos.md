### 6\. Tip 6: Use Blend IF

If you want to change the color of leaves on a tree, you can use the ‚ÄúBlend IF‚Äù option of Adobe Photoshop to precisely do the changes. Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use ‚ÄúBlend IF‚Äù sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.

This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of ‚ÄúConvert to Smart Object.‚Äù

![convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg)

It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a ‚ÄúHue and Saturation‚Äù adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.
