Apple M1 Pro reviews state that it is far better than M1 chips in performance, speed, capacity, battery life, quality, and processing.

Apple M1 Pro provides 70 percent more processing speed and performance than M1\. Here are Apple M1 pro specs, price, and release details. So that you will have a good idea about what Apple M1 Pro does and how it is better than the previous version.

### Section 1: Apple M1 Pro Specifications & Performance

Before going through any other information, it is pretty essential to understand the performance level of the Apple M1 Pro chip, not the part of the MacBook Pro system. So that if you are planning to own it or if it is not yet configured to your system, you can upgrade it to M1 Pro accordingly.

Below is mentioned the Apple M1 Pro specification details to provide you with a better perspective of the M1 Pro chip and its performance.

* **GPU:** 16 cores
* **CPU:** 10 cores (8 performance cores, 2 efficiency cores), 8 cores for 14 inches
* **RAM:** 32 GB
* **Transistors:** 33.7 billion
* **Memory Bandwidth:** 200 GB/s
* **Performance:** M1 Pro is better than the M1 version, capable of streaming about twenty 4K ProRes videos. It supports additional display.

Apple M1 Pro chipset provides the users a tremendous processing power, which is much more than M1\. It is better in terms of memory, that was just about 16 GB for M1\. Also, the video streaming is getting better with M1 Pro. Overall, it is a well-upgraded version under System on Chip after the M1 launch.

### Section 2: Apple M1 Pro Price and Release Date

Now, it's time to have an idea about the Apple M1 Pro price and its release date so that you can prepare well in advance and decide whether to go with the 14-inch model or the 16-inch one.

**Price:**

* For the 14-inch model, it is around $1999 (starting value)
* For the 16-inch model, it is around $2499

**Release Date:** October 25th, 2021
