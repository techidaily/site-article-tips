### [Twitch:](https://www.twitch.tv/)

Twitch was launched as an offshoot to Justin.tv that used to work like a general purpose streaming platform in earlier days. Twitch was designed by keeping major focus on gaming community and that is why it became too much popular in market within very less time. Other than this, Twitch can also be used for broadcasting of various live events.

## Comparison between Twitch and Hitbox

When we talk about a streaming platform then user base matters a lot; hitbox offers great services but its community is 1/10th as that of Twitch and it causes restriction over growth. If you are a real streamer then you may need a platform that offers fast growth to your career but Hitbox demand more time from your side.

Hitbox also offers a lower entry level partnership program as compared to Twitch and its added benefits are somewhere same as that of Twitch platform such as monthly subscriptions, transcoding facilities and custom emotes.

On the other side, if we talk about technology then Hitbox is far better than Twitch because it supports HTML instead of working with flash like Twitch. Also, Hitbox does not demand IRC for its chat facility.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros or Hitbox:**

* 1\. It works on HTML platform whereas Twitch does not support HTML.
* 2\. Due to small size community it is easier to boost interactions and get noticed with your activities over channel.
* 3\. It allows returns without counting status of partner. Users can try ad streaming and subscriptions etc to get faster returns. Simply the fastest solution for making money.

**Cons of Hitbox:**

* Small community will not help you to grow like a creator.

**Pros of Twitch:**

* 1\. If we talk about size of user base then Twitch is simply the largest and fastest growing community.
* 2\. Users can easily find huge audience over this network due to its big size.
* 3\. It offers much higher average revenue as compared to YTG and Hitbox.
* 4\. Works with most modern and powerful chat system.

**Cons of Twitch:**

* 1\. Although, this is a big community but still beginners need to spend long time to get noticed over here.
* 2\. It is little difficult to start income generation with Twitch because you will not get anything till the time you won’t reach up to your partner’s status.
* 3\. It works with limited bitrates that does not allow streaming above 1080p and 60 fps.
* 4\. Compatible with flash.
