When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering.

This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Framing the Text

If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Part 3: Basic Tips to Edit Text on Photo with Ease

There are multiple tips that can be employed for a clear display of text across a photo. Being a photo text editor, you need to be careful about every element that is across the photo. Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:

### 1\. Understanding the Perspective

Adding text as a perspective is believed to be an inclusive way of providing viewers with the idea of the image and helping them understand it to the fullest. If you are looking forward to writing a text on photos,you can give your text a little angle and appearance according to the image shoot for a good illusion.

### 2\. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties

It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won't tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.

### 3\. Look for Negative Space

When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering. Often referred to as negative space, utilizing that space for the text may be the perfect way that you can consider writing a text on photos. This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.

![add text in negative space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-11.jpg)

### 4\. Framing the Text

If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.

![frame the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-12.jpg)

### 5\. Control your Sizes and Styles

Make sure that you always select a font size or style that is relevant to the photo. The use of inappropriate sizes and styles in photos takes away the essence of the picture. A balance across these traits is essential for the user to bring. Capture the viewers' attention without compromising the quality of the photo itself.
