 There aren't many better options for resizing images with an iPhone because this powerful tool allows you to change the size of an image within seconds. PhotoShrinker automatically compresses the photo to one-tenth of its original size, which means that you can free up a lot of space if you choose to invest $3,99 in this app. The latest version of the app also enables you to delete photos you don't like, but its users shouldn't count on it for any other kind of photo editing activity.
