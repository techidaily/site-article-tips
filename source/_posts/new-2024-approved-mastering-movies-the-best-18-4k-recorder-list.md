#### 1\. Sony FDR-AX53/B 4K

![sony fdrax53/b 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-fdrax53-b-4k.jpg)

Sony is and has been for decades at the forefront of the revolution caused by digital cameras. The Sony FDRA53/B 4K camcorder is by no means an exception. The camcorder is equipped with Sony's state of the art image stabilization technology that helps you create crystal clear footage even when the camera is shaking. This 4K camcorder is light and easy to use, but many of its options are automatic, which prevents the user from controlling all the parameters during the recording session.

#### 2\. Sony FDR-AX33 4K

![sony fdrax33 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-fdrax33-4k.jpg)

Perhaps FDR-AX33's greatest advantage over FDR-AX53/B is the Zeiss Vario-SonarT wide-angle lens which shoots video at 26.8mm. Optical zoom can go as high as 20X in both HD and 4K modes, while the Clear Image Zoom feature can provide an additional artificial zoom boost to 30X zoom for 4K and 40X zoom for HD. The Sony FDR-AX33 4K camcorder is an excellent and above all affordable choice for average users who are not in need of the high-end professional equipment.

[Check at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R5LH9G0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00R5LH9G0&linkId=bccccf2ac73c9a6b193fdbc1bdd39ae9)

#### 3\. Sony FDR-AX100/B 4K

![sony fdr-ax100/b 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-fdr-ax100-b-4k.jpg)

The list of things this 4K camcorder can do is almost endless. The Sony FDR-AX100/B is capable of producing resolutions four times higher than Full HD, it can capture video in 4K Ultra HD at 24fps or 30fps and it can also create still frames that are as large as 20MB. The users can choose between XAVC S, AVCHD or MP4 file formats, but some of these formats demand special SD cards that can support them. Although its properties are nothing short of amazing, Sony FDR-AX100/B offers less than its price suggests.

#### 4\. Sony PXW-Z100 4K

![sony pxwz100 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-pxwz100-4k.jpg)

The Sony's PXW-Z100 4K camcorder is an excellent tool for professional videographers who demand only the best performances from their cameras. Although the camcorder features a G lens with 20X optical zoom, the lens isn't interchangeable. The Sony PXW-Z100 4K is capable of recording true 4K 4096x2160 resolution videos at up to 50 and 60fps. It utilizes Sony's XVAC 4:2:2 recording format, which means that converting the footage into a video format that can be easily played or distributed through the Internet can take a significant amount of time.

#### 9\. Panasonic AG-DVX200 4K

![panasonic ag-dvx200 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panasonic-ag-dvx200-4k.jpg)

Panasonic's AG-DVX 100 is an iconic camera that symbolizes an entire era of digital video production. AG-DVX200 is following the footsteps of its famous predecessor.

AG-UX180 is a model from the Panasonic's UX series that is quite justly labeled as a 'Premium Professional Camcorder'. It is priced at $3,495, but the 1-inch Type CMOS sensor, Full HD Slow Motion Recording at 120fps or Ultra HD/Full HD Dual Codec Recording more than justify the AG-UX180's seemingly high price. The camcorder has an integrated Leica Dicomar 20X optical zoom lens that combines four lens groups.

#### 14\. Canon XC10 4K

[Canon XC10](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a professional 4K camcorder that has DIGIC DV 5 processor and a 1-inch CMOS sensor. It can capture Ultra HD,  recording, and 50Mpbs HD recording, therefore there is no doubt that this camcorder is among the very best on the market. However, XC10 can only record 4K to CFast 2.0 cards that can be quite expensive. The camcorder's lens has a 10X optical zoom and rings for manual focus and zoom control that almost provide the feel of a DSLR, but the lens cannot be changed, which at times can limit the videographer.

![canon xc15 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-xc15-4k.jpg)

If you would like to capture your memories in crystal clear quality, Canon XC15 is the right choice for you. AXC15 is lightweight and small which makes it perfect for those who often work outdoors and have to carry a lot of equipment with them. The camcorder can be used with Canon's C300 Mk II on sets when more than just one camera is required to create consistency. The XC15 4K camcorder produces stunning results, but the camcorder's controls can be confusing even to an experienced professional.

## Things worth considering when buying a 4K camcorder

#### 1\. Easy to take with

Most camcorders available on the market today are easy to carry around, so when buying a 4K camcorder you should think about how easy the model you are planning on buying is to carry around. Also, keep in mind that lightweight cameras are more difficult to hold still.

#### 2\. Wide lens and large sensors

The sensor of a camera is perhaps its most important part. The 1-inch sensor pretty much enables you to record video in any light conditions. Most of the 4K camcorders have integrated wide angle lenses, but it is important to find out what the lens on your camcorder can and cannot do.

#### 3\. Built-in viewfinder

As great as camera displays are, they are not always reliable and you can't always be sure that the images you are seeing on the display are going to look like that once you transfer them onto your hard drive. A good viewfinder can help you to make sure that your videos are not overexposed or underexposed and that your footage is always in focus.

#### 4\. Optical Zoom

Using a camera often means that you want to record something that is not near you. Sometimes you might want to film only a detail, but without a proper lens, this task is impossible. 4K camcorders do not have interchangeable lenses which is why an optical zoom can be crucial in situations when you want to record something that is out of your reach. Most 4K camcorders also have a digital zoom, but digital zoom reduces the picture quality and it is best to avoid using it.

#### 5\. Image stabilization

Capturing motion isn't as easy as it sounds. Moving objects tend to create a blur, which is why Image stabilization techniques are such an important factor that determines the quality of any camera. Camera shake can result in unusable footage and if you are looking to buy a 4K camcorder make sure that the camera you wish to purchase has a superb Image stabilization.

#### 6\. External Microphone Jack

Internal camera sound is often too terrible to be used in the post-production. If you'd like to record professional sound for your videos make sure that the 4K camcorder has at least one XLR jack.

#### 7\. Night Vision

The camera's ability to record in the low-light conditions is not important to all users, but professionals sometimes have no other choice, but to record in terrible light conditions. Night Vision feature is important if you are planning on recording concerts or any other events that are not perfectly lit.
