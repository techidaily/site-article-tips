If you created a funny video with your friends or caught a wonderful scene in nature, you may want to send the video to someone. Or maybe you want to upload it online. The problem is that some videos have a very large file size, which makes uploading or sending it to someone difficult. That is why you may need to **compress the video on Android** before you can send it out.

The good news is that you can easily use free applications on your Android phone to compress those videos. Then you can delete the original video, free up space on your phone, and send the video out to anyone you want! Here are six apps for compressing video on Android.

## Top Six Free Android Apps for Compressing Video

#### 1. Video Compress

Video compress makes it much easier to compress videos and share them on social networks, such as Facebook, Google+, WhatsApp, and more.

![video compress](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-compress.JPG)

**Pros:**

* Can adjust the video quality between high, normal, and low for different levels of compression.
* Easy to use interface and very rapid compression process.
* Supports all video formats.
* Allows audio removal if requested, which reduces file size even further.
* Can convert a video into an audio-only MP3 file if needed.

**Cons:**

* Sometimes difficult to delete new video files from the app.
* The feature of sending video to the user through SMS does not always work.

#### 2. Resize Video

With Resize Video, you can easily compress video on Android phones and tablets. You can pick the video size that is to your liking, and you can even trim the video’s length before compression.

![resize video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resize-video.JPG)

**Pros:**

* Easy resizing ability, along with cropping and trimming of videos.
* Remote audio from videos, and add music to videos when you want.
* Share videos on social networks like Facebook, Gmail, and more.
* Save and delete videos through the app.

**Cons:**

* Some users were unhappy with the level of resizing that occurred with their videos. They wanted their videos to shrink even more.

#### 3. Video Compressor by Sunshine

Video Compressor by Sunshine is one of the few multi-video compressors available on the Play Store. You can turn multiple videos into one compressed file to save space on your phone.

![video compressor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-compressor-Sunshine.JPG)

**Pros:**

* Compresses many large files into one smaller file, if desired.
* Optimizes file space by overwriting compressed videos to give you an average of 90 percent more space on your phone.
* Options for FHD, HD, and SD settings for compression. SD will have the smallest file size.
* Transfer your compressed videos instantly.

**Cons:**

* Only compresses files you create on your phone, not ones downloaded from various online sources.

#### 4. Videos & Movies Compressor

Videos & Movies Compressor offers support for all popular video formats. The application makes it easy to compress video on Android and share it with friends or family.

![video movie compressor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Videos-Movies-Compressor.JPG)

* Sometimes the picture quality is compromised if you compress the size too much.

#### 5. Video Dieter 2

With Video Dieter, it is very simple to decide how much to compress your video. Remember that each reduction in file size reduces quality, so you will want to find the right balance. The software also makes sharing videos very easy.

![Video Dieter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Video-Dieter.JPG)

![Video compressor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-compressor-android.JPG)

**Pros:**

* Use the gallery to pick the video you want to compress.
* Support for MP4, 3GP, and AVI.
