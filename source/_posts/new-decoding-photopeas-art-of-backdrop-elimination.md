## How To Use Photopea To Remove The Image's Background

Photopea offers three options for removing the images' background, i.e., Magic Wand Tool, Magic Cut, and manual selection.  
Magic Wand tool is responsible for instantly removing the background of an image with solid colors. In comparison, the Magic Cut tool lets you erase complicated backgrounds.  
However, if the image is detailed, you have to select the object and remove the background manually. Below we've provided step-by-step guides to show you how you can use the Magic Wand and Magic Cut tools:

### 1\. How To Use The Magic Wand Tool To Remove The Image's Background

Here's how to use the Magic Wand tool to **remove the image's background with Photopea**:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your PC and visit the [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) website. Click **"Open From Computer"** to import your image file with a solid background. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your file.

Step2 In the next step, click the **"Magic Wand"** tool from the left-side panel and click the background of your image to select it.

Step3 Now, simply press the **"Delete"** button on your keyboard to remove the background. However, if the tool did not select some parts of the image's background, you need to adjust the settings. Click the **"Ctrl+Z"** key to undo the selection.

Step4 Next, find the **"Tolerance"** option in the top toolbar and increase its value until you get the appropriate number.

![adjusting the magic wand settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adjusting-the-magic-wand-settings.png)

Step5 Alternatively, you can reduce the value to deselect the parts of your image. Once you change the value, click on the background and press the **"Delete"** button to remove it.

### 2\. How To Use Magic Cut To Remove The Image's Background

If your picture has a complicated background, the following steps will help you use the Magic Cut tool to **remove the image's background with Photopea:**

Step1 In the first step, import your image file to Photopea and right-click on its background.

Step2 Next, select the **"Magic Cut"** option in the menu.

Step3 In the next window, use the red brush to mark your background, the green one to select your subject, and the grey brush to remove the automatically generated selection.

You can modify the brush size using the drop-down icon at the top-right of the window.

Step4 Once satisfied with your changes, click **"OK"** to save your settings and remove the background.

### 3\. Select the Subject Manually When The Image Is Detailed

Although Magic Cut can handle difficult photos, there are also more precise tools available in Photopea that can help you erase the background from your images through manual selection. However, this process will be slower if your image is very detailed.

Manual selection tools vary with pictures to best suit your needs, which you can find under **"Rectangle Select"** and **"Magic Wand"** in the sidebar. Right-click on these tools to see the sub-tools available for each.

Step1 Visit the Photopea website and import your image. Right-click the **"Rectangle Select"** or **"Magic Wand"** option.

Step2 Now, choose the selection tool you need from the drop-down menu. For this tutorial, we've used the **"Magnetic Lasso Selection"** option.

Step3 In the next step, select your object as precisely as possible. Now, right-click on your selection, and click **"Inverse"** from the drop-down menu.

Step4 Finally, hit the **"Delete"** button to remove the background.
