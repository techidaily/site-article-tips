Note: The "Red Eye Correction" option will not appear when the picture is captured without the use of flash. It will only be visible on the photos taken with flash and the screenshots.

**Step 4** – After this, tap the red eye one by one and the red eye correction feature will change pixels as needed on the tapped area. You can tap eye once again if the edit was not of your preference.

**Step 5** – lastly, tap on the eye with slash icon i.e. "Red Eye Correction" icon to return to the main edit screen. Hit on "Done" once satisfied with the results.
