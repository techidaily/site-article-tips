## Part 2: Using Photoshop for Meme Making

Adobe Photoshop was created as a graphic manipulator and modifier; and released by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. Since the release, the program has progressed into an industry standard for editing images, videos as well as all forms of digital art. Adobe Photoshop supports masks, alpha compositing, and a variety of color models, including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. It can also edit and compose pictures and add multiple layers to it.

To accommodate these functionalities, Photoshop uses special formats of PSD and PSB file. Photoshop has limited capabilities for editing or rendering text, vector graphics (particularly using clipping path for the latter), 3D graphics, and video in addition to make images. Along with all other incredible functions photoshop can perform, it can be easily used as a meme maker.
