## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

![minecraft game menu options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-game-menu-options.jpg)

Step3 Now, use the slider to alter your range of vision. The slider will be positioned in the center by default. To get a closer look at your surroundings, click on it and move it to the left of your screen. However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.

![minecraft fov button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-fov-button.jpg)

Step4 To save the new FOV settings after finishing adjusting the slider and being satisfied with the field of vision, click Done at the bottom of the page.

Step5 Now, after the successful zoom in on Minecraft, press Backspace to get into the menu and to continue playing, choose "Return to Game."

## Way 2\. Change FOV in Options

You may utilize the accessibility features in mac OS to get a zooming option while altering your FOV. You may reach the Minecraft window by manually adjusting the zoom in and out. To zoom in or out instead, utilize macOS' accessibility zoom function. By just dragging your mouse while holding a certain key, you may zoom in or out in any program or game window. Here's how to activate it and utilize it:

**Steps to Zoom in on Minecraft on MacOS:**

Step1 Select "Activate" next to "System Preferences" at the bottom of the dock. Select System Preferences from the drop-down menu that appears when you click on the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen.

![zoom minecraft preferences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-minecraft-preferences.jpg)

Step2 Select accessibility from the menu. To tick the box next to the zoom option on the left side of the bar, choose "Use scroll gesture with zooming modifier keys." To inspect it, use the zoom option. Use the change key, which is accessed via the control key, to automatically zoom in on the screen.

![zoom accessibilty macos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-accessibilty-macos.jpg)

Step3 To change the alteration key, click on the arrow that is pointing down and next to the box. Then, choose the command, option, or control key that you like.

![scroll gesture modifier zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/scroll-gesture-modifier-zoom.jpg)

Step4 After choosing the modifier key, open the Minecraft window and drag it to the higher or lower side of the screen to zoom in or out. Now that you know how to zoom in on Minecraft on Mac OS, all you need to do is hit and hold the modifier key of your choice while scrolling up with the mouse.

## Way 3\. Using OptiFine Mod (Java)

You may customize the zoom in and out of your Minecraft environment by using the OptiFine plugin. On your computer, you must install the necessary applications. A visual mod for Minecraft called OptiFine allows for zooming. There are other features as well, such as enhanced visuals, high-definition textures, dynamic lighting, and realistic water. This mod only works with Java Edition on operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. For Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Minecraft for mobile devices, and Minecraft for gaming consoles, this mod is not accessible.

**Steps to Zoom in on Minecraft Using Mods:**

Follow these instructions to install OptiFine and add the zooming ability to your game:

Step1 Install the Minecraft OptiFine Mod on your PC in the first step. Visit the OptiFine Mod website and choose "Preview versions" to examine the most recent version of the most innovative Minecraft 1.15 beta. To use the most recent update in Minecraft. Similarly, if you don't already have one, download and install the most recent Java SE Development Kit on your PC.

**Note:** For your most recent version of Minecraft, go to optifine.net and select the Downloads page to get the most recent version of OptiFine. By selecting the Show all versions option, you may download the OptiFine compatible version of Minecraft if your current version is out of date.

Step2 Double-click the downloaded OptiFine file to open it and finish the installation. The OptiFine Mod has been added to Minecraft as of late. Check to see whether the OptiFine mod has been loaded into the game by using the Minecraft launcher.

![install optifine file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-optifine-file.jpg)

Step3 Start the launcher in Minecraft in the next step. If OptiFine does not appear in the drop-down menu, click Installations at the top of the launcher. Then click New in the top-left corner of the screen. Write OptiFine to install. From the Version menu, choose the version that has OptiFine in the title.

Step4 Verify that OptiFine Mod is loaded into the program by checking this box. You may now see OptiFine on the bottom left of the Play option. If you can't see that, pick OptiFine by tapping the box next to the play choice; it is often the most recent release.

![optifine controls zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/optifine-controls-zoom.jpg)

Step5 In the Minecraft launch, choose the Play option and click to load a game. While playing the game, hit the keyboard's "c" key to close in on the target in the center. This key may be used to zoom in at any time. Now that you have used the OptiFine Mod in Minecraft to zoom in, you may do so.

![click load minecraft game](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-load-minecraft-game.jpg)

## Way 4\. Using a Spyglass

In Minecraft, the spyglass is used to zoom in so that a player may see well at a greater distance than is typically feasible. This is incredibly helpful while exploring diverse biomes since it enhances your eyesight and makes it simple to find monsters or precious materials that are hidden from view. Players may now create a zooming item in Minecraft. The new Spyglass item that enables users to zoom in on certain places was introduced to Minecraft in the 1.17 release. The spyglass is a creatable item in Minecraft that enables users to alter their Field of Vision anytime they want to without visiting the settings page. On your Minecraft crafting table, you may create a spyglass.

Step1 Create a Spyglass by following the newest version guide of Minecraft.

![create a spyglass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-spyglass.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step2 After that, put the Spyglass you just created in your menu bar and take a hold of it. When you use it, your eyesight will enlarge the area you are focusing on. The same effect as altering your FoV in the settings is achieved with this, but it is faster, simpler, and has more zooming. You cannot lower the FoV setting below 30 by altering it in the menu.

![spyglass options panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-options-panel.jpg)

Step3 However, you will always zoom in to 10% of your current Field of View while using your Spyglass. When using a spyglass, for instance, your zoom level will be 6 if your field of view is set to 60\. As a result, a Spyglass will allow you to see objects considerably further away.

![spyglass settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-settings.jpg)

Step4 On the crafting table, arrange 2 copper ingots and 1 amethyst shard in the exact same configuration as in the illustration below to create a spyglass.

![crafting table spyglass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crafting-table-spyglass.jpg)

## Way 5\. Use Zoomed-Out Maps

You might think about making a zoomed-out map of your planet in addition to providing a mod to zoom in for simpler navigation. The map may be useful for several reasons, including returning to a certain area, such as your home base. When playing Minecraft, you can make a map and utilize it to gain a zoomed-out perspective of your world.

Step1 Gather the materials needed to make a map in the first step. These include a compass, a crafts table, and sugar cane (used to make paper).

![use zoom out maps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-out-maps.jpg)

Step2 Nine sheets of paper will be made from the sugar cane. Open the crafting table, and then put three pieces of sugar cane on each of the bottom squares to make them. To add paper to your inventory, click and drag it to the right-hand box's paper icon.

![add paper to inventory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-paper-to-inventory.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step3 At this point, we may start drawing a map. Put the compass in the center square of the handicraft grid, then fill up all the other squares with paper. Now that the crafts grid is open, fill each square with paper and set a compass in the center. To add the yellow piece of paper to the inventory, click and drag it over to the right.

Step4 In order to utilize the map, choose it from the Equip bar at the bottom of the game screen, then right-click (or press and hold on a mobile device). After the first time, repeat the instructions to build 2048 x 2048 blocks, which will give you the greatest magnification. You may stroll about your planet while wearing the map to record all of its features and landmarks as shown below:
