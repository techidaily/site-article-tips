The [Canon EF 135mm f/2L USM Lens](https://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-135mm-f-2.0-L-USM-Lens-Review.aspx) is one of the best lenses on the market for shooting music videos. It has an UltraSonic motor, 135mm focal length, and a focus distance of 3 feet. You can also get it with a polarizer or a UV Protection Filter.

The speed and versatility of this lens allows you to get some beautiful video, and it works with most models of camera that we’ve discussed in this article.

4\.   **How long does it take to make a music video?**

It depends on exactly what it is that you are doing in the video. Most of the time, artists have some sort of idea as to what their main concept will be in the video, and who they want to work with. Otherwise, the record label will be in charge of such things. In general, this depends on the song being recorded and what sort of budget is being worked with.

On average, it takes around **two weeks** to get everything recorded and ready to go; it could take longer on the front end and back end when it comes to organizing and scheduling.
