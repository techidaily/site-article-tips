## Mastering PIP Feature in YouTube App for iPhones

Picture in Picture is now available on YouTube on all platforms and devices in the USA. You can manipulate this magic quality of your device to enjoy the experience. You can enable or disable PIP on iPhone or any other device anytime anywhere so that you use the feature desirably. When you enable PIP in any app on your device, it means that as you open any video, the video will automatically start on Picture in Picture mode.

After opening the video in PIP mode, you can do things around on the screen of your device as the video plays on a floating window. You will be able to resize and drag the window along as you carry along with other activities on your phone or PC.

## Part 1\. How to enable Picture in Picture for YouTube on iPhone

To enable PIP on iPhone on YouTube and use it better, you should be a premium YouTube subscriber. Picture in Picture on iPhone depends on the version of your phone. And here, I am going to tell you how to enable PIP on the latest versions of iPhones.

On iOS 14.5 or 14.6, here is a simple step-by-step guide to enable Picture in Picture for YouTube PIP. You will need two additional apps to do this: Shortcuts and Scriptable. And both are freely accessible from the App Store.

1. Go to **Settings** of your device
2. Tap the **Shortcut** extension in Settings
3. Turn on **Allow Untrusted Shortcuts**. If this option is not available for your device, go to **Screen Time extension** and disable any screen time restrictions. So, you will proceed successfully.

![enable pip on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-for-youtube-on-iphone-1.jpg)

1. If you require a **YouTube PIP** shortcut app on your device to proceed, you can download it from App Store or [the Shortcuts Gallery browser](https://shortcutsgallery.com/shortcuts/youtube-pip/) and then add it to your Shortcut Library.
2. Open the **YouTube PIP** Shortcut and tap **Get Shortcut** on the App. You will be redirected to the shortcut application on your phone. If you don't have the shortcut application, you can download it from the App Store.

![shortcut application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-for-youtube-on-iphone-2.jpg)

1. Tap **Allow Untrusted Shortcuts** in the Shortcut Application on your device
2. Now go to the actual YouTube App and start to play a video
3. As the video plays, tap on the **Share icon** then scroll to the right end of the list of sharing options for platforms and Apps. Tap the **More icon** at the right end.
4. On the list of additional sharing options, go to YouTube PIP.
5. Tap on **YouTube PIP** and a burner will pop out at the top of your phone.
6. Tap on the burner that pops out. It will direct you to the actual shortcut for YouTube. And you will need to install an additional Application (Scriptable App).

![scriptable app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-for-youtube-on-iphone-3.jpg)

1. Tap on **View in App Store** on the screen that appears. This will direct you to the App Store.
2. On the next screen that appears, download [**Scriptable App**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188). Get back to the home screen and launch Scriptable App once.

![download scriptable app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/picture-in-picture-for-youtube-on-iphone-4.jpg)

1. Go to YouTube again and start any video. Tap the **Share icon**, scroll to the right and tap the **More icon**, go ahead and tap the YouTube PIP. And on the burner that pops up at the top of the screen of your phone, tap **OK**.
