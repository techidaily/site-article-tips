* Limited dynamic range and poor high ISO performance compared to cameras with larger sensors
* Soft corners at some focal lengths even stopped-down
* Strong distortion correction at wide-angle (typical)
* Default noise reduction is a little heavy-handed (though NR can be adjusted)
* Area-specific noise reduction can lead to rough edges and other artifacts
* JPEG colors could be better
* Clunky menu system
