Unfortunately, some do not allow you to download stock images without a watermark. This is because of the unique licenses they offer with their content.

Keep reading to learn more about downloading stock images without watermarks. In addition, you will discover if it is OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use.

## Part1:Why not use stock photos with watermarks?

![watermarks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-1.jpg)

This is because it infringes on the image's copyright, which can land you in legal trouble. In addition, stock photo contributors can choose to include watermarks in their images as a way of copyrighting their work. As such, they can command royalty payments from the stock photograph website and other users who download their images.

In addition, the stock photos watermark informs other users who to contact when they want to use your images for personal and commercial use. Therefore, they can sue you for extra damages if you use their images without purchasing the rights.

Another reason why it is not OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use is that it looks unprofessional. Typically, stock photo watermarks cover the middle of the photo, making it near unusable for potential copyright violators. In addition, using a watermarked stock photo for your messaging can harm your brand. This is because it indicates to your audience that you are cheap and do not appreciate other people's hard work.

## Part2: How to get watermark-free stock photos?

Now that using stock photos with watermarks can land you in trouble, how can you get watermark-free stock photos for commercial use? Here are some of the methods you should consider.

### Method 2: Make good use of paid stock sites

Alternatively, you can also use paid stock sites to download stock photos without a watermark. Most businesses and ad agencies prefer paid stock sites because they allow you access to exclusive images. Depending on your subscription, you can access premium images from some of the industry's best stock photographers. However, some paid sites also include complementary items with their subscriptions. Here are a few examples of where to download free stock photos without a watermark.

      * Flexible usage rights allow you to include the images in your personal and commercial work.
      * Professionally vetted content to ensure high-quality and that it meets all legal requirements for free use.
      * In addition, you receive up to $10,000 legal protection, provided you use the content within the terms of the iStock license.
      * Furthermore, you can avail of the weekly freebies the site offers to registered users.

Please note that you need to have a verified user account to receive the complimentary offers. In addition, the site offers a free one-month trial with 10 free downloads from the Essentials collection.

1. **Adobe Stock**

Alternatively, you can get stock images without a watermark from Adobe Stock. Although the site is fairly new compared to the ones above, it now ranks as one of the creative industry's top stock content sites. In addition, the site hosts millions of high-quality curated and royalty-free content from thousands of contributors.

      * The site will only charge you after the trial period ends. Then, you will need to pay $29.99 to download 10 assets monthly.
      * You can cancel your account risk-free within thirty days of registering for an Adobe Stock account.

### Method 3: Shoot your stock photos

You can also get stock photos without watermarks by shooting your photos. Unfortunately, not everyone can shoot professional photos worthy of commercial use. However, here are some tips to help you get the right stock image for commercial use.

* Have the correct light conditions to increase your image detail.
* Use your camera's auto-adjust settings for the best image quality.
* Take multiple shots to increase your choices for the best photo.

![get free stock media resources](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-5.jpg)

You can also use Wondershare Filmora to get free stock media resources for your commercial creations. The video editing software features Filmstock, a library of stock content, including images, videos, royalty-free sound effects, and music.

In addition, Filmora integrates Unsplash.com, pixabay.com, and many other stock media sites into the software. Here is how you can access free stock media resources through Filmstock.

* Launch the Filmora Video Editor from your device.
* Click on **New Project** to access the project workspace.
* Tap on the **Effects** tab and press the **Filmstock** button.
* You will then be redirected to the Filmstock website, where you will be prompted to log in to your Wondershare account.
* Once logged in, you will have access to the creative asset library. In addition, you can access the free content by changing the **Library** type to Free from the **Filmora Effects** page.

Unfortunately, all free content you download from Filmstock includes the Filmora tag. In addition, you should not remove the watermark with editing software because it violates copyright law. Instead, you can avoid legal liability by purchasing the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Business Plan.

The subscription allows you to use all effects for commercial use, except the music tracks. However, you will need to contact the company for extended license services once you use the assets in more than 500,000 commercial reproductions.
