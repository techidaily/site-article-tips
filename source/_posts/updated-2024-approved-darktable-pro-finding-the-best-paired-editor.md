### The reasons why it is not worth pick

#### 1\. Some features are lacking

This tool still has to proceed with Lightroom Classic in some of the areas.

#### 2\. Lightroom classic vs. lightroom

Users still for the most advanced projects of editing need to pick the Classic version over the normal one.
