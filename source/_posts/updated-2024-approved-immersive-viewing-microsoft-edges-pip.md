## Immersive Viewing: Microsoft Edge's PIP

Picture-in-Picture is an important feature on Windows and Android computers. It allows you to watch videos while they float on the screen of your desktop or smartphone.

2. By Using Global Media Control
3. By installing Picture in Picture Extension on Microsoft Edge
