## Design and Connections

Addition of advanced 3D support into a device increases its overall weight by 2 grams but still if you compare it with other devices then this weight will be considered as lighter. Users love the textured black plastic casing of this device that is equipped with front left tray loading system. This device is designed with minimalistic controls so the last important things that you are going to find on its body are power and eject buttons only. USB port is available on one side that provides easy connectivity for external storage devices. You will not be able to find any display panel on this device but the green LED provides indication whenever device is switched on.

If we compare this design with BP350 then the remote control feature can be found with improved appearance. It offers well designed tiny buttons with impressive layout that assists beginners with easy controls. Other than this, you can access all controls via LG 4G Remote App that is compatible with iOS and Android platform. A nice addition of HDMI output as compared to its predecessor is available so that users can directly avail digital audio out and the LAN port assists in easy HD streaming.

## Operation

Once you start using LG’s BP550 device you will love its abilities and convenience that it offers to every user with ease. Deck always responds smoothly whenever users switch between different folders on music servers or whenever they try to punch passwords. However, the menu system is almost same as that of its predecessor. The home menu is impressively easy to navigate with a row of five well managed tiles that appear good against a gray background. All the app highlights as well as corresponding app statuses are displayed in a purple section below. If you want to adjust settings then follow the menu and it makes everything simple even with better control on all critical adjustments.

When it is time to delve into DLNA server then users can navigate inside for easy access of content from so many folders. Once you start playing a track, it will immediately appear on the whole screen and a beautiful cover art will appear along with elapsed time and playlist information. The online content menu is showcased via grid of tiles that reflect a cartoony backdrop but looks beautiful. You can jump between different apps as it provides better control on cursor that is highly smooth. When you need direct access to Option and Disc Menus then simply hit the info button at the time of playback and the banner appears on bottom side of screen. All useful apps like Spotify and BBC iPlayer works smoothly on this platform while allowing easy access to streaming. The info button will provide you perfect details about disc related to subtitles, audio formats etc. further, you can have easy controls over Movie, Vivid and standard settings. Users can make fine adjustments over sharpness, colour, brightness and contrast.

You will get one remote unit with this system that makes controlling much easier with an intuitive button type layout. The useful playback keys are well placed over ‘hump’ and they have light controlled appearance with dark and bright settings. The large direction panel assists users with ease navigation controls. Alternatively, users can connect their smartphones with this device via Wi-Fi connectivity and it is compatible with iOS and Android platform. This remote access can be used to access various apps, playback controls, DLNA servers and for track streaming.

## Performance

Now, with this improved LG product we have something to talk about 3D performance that was earlier missing in its predecessors. No matter what kind of procedures and technologies were used to transmit digital information, you will always find results for 3D images impressive. If you must leave picture options alone then BP550 can assist you with perfect colour blending along with well adjusted gamma curve. It is also possible to make few picture altering adjustments that are available in Options Menu below Info/Menu button of remote.

If you work with standard picture mode then it will offer perfect transmission of signals between different platforms. Both Video ad Cinema modes produce colour information but it should not be messed up with illumination. User mode is highly important as it displays things as per standard with impressive basic controls over brightness, color, contrast etc.
