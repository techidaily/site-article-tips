Step 2: Now, you need to change the URL of the video you are playing. Here are the changes to make in the address bar.

* Remove everything at the beginning of "vimeo.com". Add ".player" at the beginning of the URL.

Step 3: After making the changes, press Enter key. The same video will play in a loop until you pause the video or close the web browser's tab.
