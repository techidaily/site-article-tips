### Features on Filmora Teachers Could Use to Improve Educational Videos

**Text to Speech**

Text-to-speech technology lets machines read text aloud with natural-sounding voices. Educators can use this to add narration to educational videos. That helps explain the lessons better.

Type a narration and add it to the parts of the video where they are needed. Then, use text-to-speech.

**Screen Recorder**

The screen recorder feature is handy for lessons that need a lot of explaining or demonstration. It will let you convert the Paint app or another app into a digital whiteboard.

![screen recording software for teachers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/screen-recording-software-teachers.jpg)

One example is when teaching students how blood circulates. How does blood enter the heart, and how does it exit it? You can screen record a video of you explaining that through drawing arrows in an app.

**Split Screen**

You can utilize the split screen feature when teaching the differences between things. Use one screen to show one of the subjects and one for the thing you are comparing it with. For example, on one screen, you can show how Reykjavik, Iceland looks at 8 pm. On the other screen, show what it looks like at Reykjavik's antipodal point at the same time.

![split screen video for education](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split-screen-video-education.jpg)
