## Elite Guide: From Concept to Compelling Fullscreen Edits in Premiere Pro

Getting a full screen preview of your project is an important post-production step. This is because the default preview window of most editors can be too small to show all the flaws in your clips. For example, you may have missed a spot during the color correction, which you would have missed when using normal view. However, accessing the function varies with the software and your device's operating system. Here is how to access premiere pro full screen preview from different devices.

## Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of a videographer's best video editing software. This is because it offers you one of the largest libraries of creative and editing assets. Furthermore, you can work cross-platform through the Creative Clouds service.

Unfortunately, this becomes challenging for Windows and macOS users because of the operation difference between their devices. For example, the key names differ on each device's keyboard. Windows Keyboards feature the CTRL key, and Apple offers the COMMAND key instead. As such, it is challenging to locate functions with HOTKEYS.

Below is a full guide on how to access Premiere full screen preview on both devices.

### **Windows Users**

1. Launch Adobe Premiere Pro from your device and open your project file.
2. Once all the clips load on their tracks, you begin editing with the suite of creative assets from the program library. Some of the edits you can do include applying color LUTS and green screen.
3. Then, tap the **Play** button or the **SPACEBAR** key on your keyboard to preview your work.
4. To enable a large screen preview, press the Grave Key (represent by **\~** on a Windows keyboard. Also it shares the key with \`) to enlarge the preview window.
5. To activate Premier Pro full screen preview, just tab the same key while pressing Ctrl. In addition, the HOT KEY shortcut works with every video clip you want to preview.

1. Finally, you deactivate the function by pressing **CTRL** and **\~** to return to the normal screen.

### **macOS Users**

The process for macOS users is similar to the above. However, you will notice a difference in the HOT KEYS shortcuts.

1. Launch the program and click on the Open Project option to access your project. Alternatively, you can directly access the program by clicking the project file on your storage device.
2. Then, select the clip you want to preview and hit the SPACEBAR to play the video. You can also activate play by clicking the Play button from your monitor panel.
3. To enable a full screen preview, simply **press Control Key** (represented by a ^ on the Mac keyboard) while tapping the **Grave Key (represented by a ')** on your keyboard to activate the Premiere full screen preview. In addition, you can deactivate it by hitting the combination again. It's quite easy to reach with only the left hand.

Pro tips: If you still find the combination complex, here's how to change it:

First, click "Premiere Pro" on the top menu, and choose Keyboard Shortcuts.

![premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-4.jpg)

Then, search for "Full" and you will see the defult shortcut. Click to change it to keys you want.

Did you know you can also determine safe zone margins using Premiere Pro? These varying border lines on your Monitor Panel help you determine which objects are out of frame. Unfortunately, the feature is unavailable on previews or export files. Regardless, it is an extremely useful feature for your post-production. Follow these steps to enable it in your projects.

* Launch Premiere Pro on your device and import your clip to the Monitor Panel.
* Select the clip you want to edit and right-click on the screen.
* Enable the Safe Margins option by checking the box beside its name.

## Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?

So, you now know how to access Adobe Premiere Pro Full Screen Preview, but there is a problem. Your videos are not playing right, and you are wondering what to do. Here are a few solutions when you notice full screen preview is lagging

### 1\. Fix your video rendering and playback setting

Adobe Premiere Pro is configured to utilize your device's GPU for rendering. However, using the wrong video rendering and playback settings can cause your full screen preview to lag. Follow these steps to fix the problem.

* Tap on **Project settings** to open the settings menu.
* Then, proceed to **Renderer** to view your current settings. You will find the option under video rendering and playback.
* Choose your device's GPU as the default option to activate GPU acceleration. In addition, you will need a compatible graphics processing unit to support this function.

### 2\. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature

Another reason for full screen preview lag is Mercury Transmit. The feature allows you to transmit your video to a secondary screen. However, it takes up valuable RAM, especially when you do not own a second monitor. Here is how to disable it.

* Open your program settings and proceed to the **Playback**
* Uncheck the **Enable Mercury Transmit** option in the resulting menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Always update your system hardware and software

Sometimes your full screen previews may lag because you miss the latest updates. Typically, developers provide users with free regular updates to make their software run better. For example, Adobe Premiere Pro issues regular updates to fix bugs and provide you with more creative library content.

As such, ensure you have the **Check For Updates** function enabled in your programs. Kindly note the feature only works if your device has an active internet connection.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Play the video at a lower playback resolution

It is not wrong wanting to preview your video at 4K resolution. However, this can cause the program to lag significantly, especially if your device has low specs. In addition, changing your preview's playback resolution does not affect its export settings. Follow these steps to make the changes:

* Access the **Playback Resolution** menu of your video clip from the **Settings**
* Then, alternate between lower values until the video lag stops. Currently, you can lower your Premiere full screen preview playback resolution up to 1/16 the original value.
