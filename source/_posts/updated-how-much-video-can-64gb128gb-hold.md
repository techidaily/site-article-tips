Go to the Format tab and set the output to the original video format. Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by selecting a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. If the video format is not important to you, you can choose from various formats such as FLV, MP4, and others, which produce lower files.
