## Part 2\. Tips to Choose a Title for Your YouTube Video

Top YouTubers earn millions of dollars annually for a reason. And one of the reasons for this is that they are skilled at creating titles for YouTube videos that attract viewers.

But there's no denying that, when used properly, clickbait titles are effective at attracting users' attention and encouraging clicks. Even while there isn't a set length requirement for YouTube video titles, using these pointers can help you come up with a catchy, keyword-rich title.

* Be innovative and come up with something no one else is doing right now if you want to attract attention with your video title.
* By doing some keyword research, you can find out what people are searching for on Google and YouTube, and then utilize one of those terms or phrases to create a title.
* Using a narrative strategy might make you stand out from the competition since people are attracted to tales.
* Include the most important information at the beginning of your title since lengthier titles are more likely to get chopped off in search page results.
* By being detailed, you provide the reader information they may use to decide if your movie is what they are searching for. By doing this, you could appear higher in search results.
* People also like information that has numbers and lists. Numbers in titles increase the likelihood that they will be clicked on.
