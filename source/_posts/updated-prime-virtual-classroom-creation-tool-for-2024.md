Making sure that the names of your webinars are obvious might be quite rewarding.

**Make the target audience the title of your webinar:** Use the name of your target audience as another clever but straightforward approach for selecting the ideal webinar names. Since you would first get their attention in this scenario, using such a goal will be of great assistance to you. You could wish to do it by using the name of a group of professionals or locals.
