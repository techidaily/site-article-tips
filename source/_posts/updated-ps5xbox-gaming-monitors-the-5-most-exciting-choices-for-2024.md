PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have proved to be excellent 4K gaming consoles, but to maximize the experience, you'll also need a high-quality gaming TV. You can play games on almost any TV, but would you rather get an experience built around 4K 120Hz games with HDR colors?

A good gaming TV should deliver a clear 4K picture with best-in-class black levels and the brightest highlights, along with spectacular color. While you are at it, you need to make sure that your 4K gaming TV is equipped with HDMI 2.1 ports. This will enable you to carry all the data needed to play a game in 4K at 120Hz. In this article, we aim to look at the top 5 best tv ps5 and Xbox series X compatible options in 2024.
