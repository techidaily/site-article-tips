## Airdrop Setting on iOS

Airdrop contains three options to choose from, Off, Contacts Only, and Everyone. The users can select any of these options depending upon their needs and requirements. But the Contacts Only is the most complex option of all. It requires you to verify the person with whom you want to be connected. To avoid this complexity, we recommend you choose "Everyone".

**Step 01:** Open Settings of your iPhone or iPad device.

**Step 02:** From all these options, Tap on General

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios.png)

**Step 03:** Now select Airdrop

**Step 04:** From these three options, make sure to choose "Everyone"

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios2.jpg)

It will make your device visible to everyone around you whether they are on your contact list or not.

## Airdrop Setting on Mac

If you are trying to use Airdrop from iPhone or iPad to Mac but the mac is not being shown in the list, try the following steps.

**Step 01:** Click on the Finder

**Step 02:** It will open a new window. Under this window, select Airdrop from the sidebar

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step2.jpg)

**Step 03:** At the bottom of the screen, you can an option named "Allow me to be discovered by". Click on it and select Everyone from the drop-down list.

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step3.jpg)

By doing this, you will make your Mac device ready to be paired with other devices around you. After changing these settings, the Airdrop will start to work fine.

Is airdrop not working yet? If you are still facing the same problem try toggling off and on the Wifi and Bluetooth of your iPhone and Mac. By doing so, it will refresh the state of Wifi and Bluetooth of your device and make sure that they are working fine.

You can do that on your iPhone simply by navigating to Settings > Wi-Fi. Now tap the Wi-Fi switch on/off twice.

The same is the case with Bluetooth. Navigate to Settings > Bluetooth. Now tap the Bluetooth switch on/off twice.

![airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-mac-step5.jpg)

After completing all the stated methods, the Airdrop will start to work properly. But it is important for your device to be compatible with Airdrop. Check your device in the list of compatible devices before trying these methods. If you are still facing the same problem of Airdrop not working, then the last option is to reset your device.

1. Press and Hold On/Off button
2. Press and Hold the volume down button until the screen is off and turns on again and displays the Apple logo.

**For iPad & iPhone 6 and earlier**
