## Conclusion

If you're a video content creator, then you must be familiar with the benefits SRT files add to your video. It is not only helpful to add auto-generated text to your videos, but also increases your video reach and accessibility.

The article above has covered everything about converting zip to srt with or without software. So, make sure you read through every ZIP to SRT conversion procedure and choose the one that suits your needs. However, if you want to wait your SRT files to be high quality, we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for a smooth and successful SRT editing operation.
