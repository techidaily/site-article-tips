## Part 2: Frequently Asked Questions about Playing 4K Videos

### 1\. What is a 4K video?

A [4K video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a video that is recorded in the 4K resolution. The horizontal side of a 4K video has approximately 4000 pixels, while in most cases, 4K videos displayed on monitors and TVs have a resolution of 3840X2160 pixels. The movie industry standard is 4096x2160 pixels.

Ultimately, the 4K video’s resolution depends on its aspect ratio, as slight variations occur with either of the most commonly used aspect ratios for 4K videos. This, however, doesn’t affect the image quality.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. How to play a 4K video on a PC?

You must install a media player that enables you to watch 4K videos on your PC in order to view 4K content. So, once you’ve installed a media player that can play 4K videos, you just have to open the video file with the media player of your choice.

In addition, you are going to need a 4K display to view the video in full resolution because HD or Full HD displays can’t play 4K footage in full detail.

### 3\. Do you need a special media player for 4K videos?

At the moment, Windows and macOS don’t have a built-in media player that can play 4K videos. However, this is no cause for alarm because there are numerous media players you can install on either of these operating systems for free.

VLC or 5KPlayer are just a few options you will have at your disposal, but you should also keep in mind that you have to install appropriate codecs on your computer if you want to use it to watch 4K videos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. What is the difference between 1080p and 4K videos?

The total amount of pixels a 1080p and 4K video contains is not the same. Consequently, the amount of details a 4K video can depict is much more significant than on 1080p videos. That is also the reason why 4K video files are much larger than Full HD video files that contain significantly fewer pixels.

However, it is nearly impossible to spot a difference between a [1080p video and 4K video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from afar, but as you zoom in, you will notice that pixelization occurs at different zoom levels.

### 5\. Is the 4K video available on YouTube?

Yes, it is. YouTube has offered support for 4K videos since 2010, and you shouldn’t have too much trouble finding 4K content on this video hosting platform. In case you would like to upload a 4K video to your YouTube channel, you should arm yourself with patience since the duration of this process depends on the size of the file you’re trying to upload.
