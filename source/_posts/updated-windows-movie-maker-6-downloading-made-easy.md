Step4 Windows Movie Maker 6 does come with a lot of brand-new transitions and effects. Among other things, you may split and change the pace of the imported video to create humorous or scary slow-motion or high-speed situations. Additionally, you may modify the music video to synchronize the visual and sound perfectly. Turn up the music's volume, let it fade out gradually, and create the ideal setting.
